1
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:00,054
I wish you wouldn't do that around me.
It's so filthy !

2
00:03:00,138 --> 00:03:03,641
- Don't give me a problem
about the cigarettes.
- It's such a filthy habit.

3
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:06,811
Oh, my God !
Look at this.

4
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:12,358
Oh, Jesus !
This is so appalling !

5
00:03:13,568 --> 00:03:15,528
I can't believe it !

6
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:18,031
I can't believe
they gave it to him.

7
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:26,247
Ah, this is pathetic !

8
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:28,541
Now he's a loser
with a Jaguar.

9
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:31,544
Seriously, who did he have to blow
to get that thing ?

10
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:35,673
- Good morning, sir.
- Mr. Willis.

11
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:38,510
- It's really, uh,
- Mr. Trask !

12
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:40,512
quite a piece
of machinery.

13
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:43,348
- Good morning, Havemeyer.
- Morning to you, sir.

14
00:03:43,431 --> 00:03:45,517
- Bene !
- Bene ?

15
00:03:45,558 --> 00:03:47,769
- Bene ! Fabulous !
- What's fabulous ?

16
00:03:47,852 --> 00:03:50,063
That fine piece of steel
you have back there.

17
00:03:50,146 --> 00:03:52,190
Ah, you don't think
I deserve it.

18
00:03:52,273 --> 00:03:56,736
No, sir. On the contrary.
I think it's great.

19
00:03:56,778 --> 00:04:01,282
Should the headmaster of Baird be seen
putt-putting around in some junker ?

20
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:03,827
In fact, I think the
board of trustees have had...

21
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:07,205
their first, true stroke
of inspiration in some time.

22
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:11,584
Thank you, Havemeyer.
I'll take that at face value.

23
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:13,753
I'd expect
nothing less, sir.

24
00:04:13,837 --> 00:04:17,048
Have a good day.

25
00:04:18,633 --> 00:04:20,635
- Morning, Mrs. Hunsaker.
- Good morning.

26
00:04:20,718 --> 00:04:24,222
What have we here,
Murderer's Row ?

27
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:32,564
- What was that about ?
- Nothing. Just saying hello.

28
00:04:32,647 --> 00:04:36,109
I like to say hello
to Headmaster Trask.

29
00:04:36,192 --> 00:04:39,404
Sugarbush. Lift tickets and
condo vouchers.

30
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:43,283
- I thought we were goin' to Stowe.
- Sugarbush is Stowe, Jimmy.

31
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:47,412
We're doing it right. Thanksgiving
in Vermont, Christmas in Switzerland --

32
00:04:47,495 --> 00:04:49,664
-Christmas in Gstaad is gonna cost us --
-'Staad.

33
00:04:49,747 --> 00:04:52,917
The "G" is silent.
'Staad. George ?

34
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:54,544
- 'Staad.
- Trent ?

35
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:56,963
- 'Staad, man.
- So what about 'Staad ?

36
00:04:57,046 --> 00:04:58,923
Fine. The "G" may be silent,

37
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:01,676
but it's gonna take at least
three grand to get there.

38
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:05,805
- I'll talk to my father.
- Better yet, have my father
talk to your father.

39
00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:08,600
Or my father
talk to your father.

40
00:05:10,477 --> 00:05:13,104
You goin' home
this weekend, Chas ?

41
00:05:13,188 --> 00:05:15,315
Uh, I don't know.

42
00:05:15,398 --> 00:05:18,067
You goin' home to fuckin' Idaho
for Thanksgiving ?

43
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:20,320
I'm from Oregon.

44
00:05:20,403 --> 00:05:22,572
I meant fuckin' Oregon.

45
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:25,658
-Charlie, how do you feel about skiing ?

46
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:30,371
You in the mood for
the white-bosomed slopes of Vermont ?

47
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:33,333
Got a deal going.
20% off for my friends.

48
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:36,377
My father set it up.
Christmas in Switzerland.

49
00:05:36,461 --> 00:05:38,713
- 'Staad.
- Gstaad. Dropping the "G" is phony.

50
00:05:38,797 --> 00:05:42,008
- You said everybody says 'Staad.
- Not if you've been there.

51
00:05:42,091 --> 00:05:45,261
Easter in Bermuda,
then Kentucky Derby weekend.

52
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:47,472
We could fit you in, kid.

53
00:05:47,514 --> 00:05:51,392
Well, how much are
these white-bosomed slopes of Vermont ?

54
00:05:51,476 --> 00:05:53,394
Twelve hundred !

55
00:05:53,478 --> 00:05:57,649
Includes a nine-course,
champagne thanksgiving dinner.

56
00:05:57,732 --> 00:06:01,402
$1200 is a little rich
for my blood, Harry.

57
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:03,488
Well, how short
are you ?

58
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:05,657
How short, Harry ?

59
00:06:05,698 --> 00:06:09,410
So short it wouldn't be worth the
trouble of you and George to measure.

60
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:12,413
- But, thanks for askin', all right ?
- Mm-hmm.

61
00:06:12,497 --> 00:06:16,960
- If you change your mind --
- What'd you do that for ?
You know he's on aid.

62
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:19,671
On major holidays, Willis, it's
customary for the lord of the manor...

63
00:06:19,754 --> 00:06:23,007
- to offer drippings to the poor.
- You're so full of shit !

64
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:52,203
- Hi. Mrs. Rossi ?
- Yes ?

65
00:06:52,287 --> 00:06:56,249
I'm here about
the weekend job.

66
00:06:56,332 --> 00:06:58,251
Come on in.

67
00:07:02,881 --> 00:07:05,884
Does he got pimples ?
He hates pimples.

68
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:07,719
Francine, be quiet.

69
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:10,430
Pimples. Pimples.
Yeah.

70
00:07:10,513 --> 00:07:12,932
Shush !
I'm sorry.

71
00:07:13,016 --> 00:07:16,186
- The school gave me your name,
but I've forgotten it.
- It's Charlie Simms.

72
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:18,438
- How are you, Charlie ?
- Fine, thanks.

73
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:20,732
Right this way.

74
00:07:23,234 --> 00:07:27,071
- You're available the whole weekend ?
- Uh, yeah.

75
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:29,240
- Not going home for Thanksgiving ?
- No.

76
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:32,202
Good.

77
00:07:32,243 --> 00:07:35,371
They put him in a veteran's home,
but he hated it,

78
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:37,957
so I told my dad
that we'd take him.

79
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:42,921
Before you go in, do you mind
my telling you a few things ?

80
00:07:43,004 --> 00:07:47,425
Don't "sir" him and don't ask him
too many questions.

81
00:07:47,509 --> 00:07:52,222
And if he staggers a little when
he gets up, don't pay any attention.

82
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:56,976
Charlie, I can tell you're
the right person for the job.

83
00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:00,980
and Uncle Frank's
gonna like you a lot too.

84
00:08:01,064 --> 00:08:03,566
Uh, where you gonna be
this weekend ?

85
00:08:03,608 --> 00:08:05,777
We're driving to Albany.

86
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:10,740
Donny, my husband,
has family there.

87
00:08:15,537 --> 00:08:18,039
- Do you want Tommy in or out ?
- Leave him out !

88
00:08:18,122 --> 00:08:22,627
He's chasin' that Calico ginch
from the track houses again !

89
00:08:28,466 --> 00:08:31,302
Down deep, the man
is a lump of sugar.

90
00:08:51,823 --> 00:08:55,326
- Sir ?
- Don't call me sir !

91
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:58,830
I-I'm sorry.
I mean mister, sir.

92
00:08:58,872 --> 00:09:02,709
Uh-oh, we got a moron here,
is that it ?

93
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:06,796
No, mister --
Uh, that is --

94
00:09:06,838 --> 00:09:09,632
Uh, Lieutenant.
Yes, sir, Lieu--

95
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:11,926
Lieutenant Colonel.

96
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:16,848
26 years on the line, nobody ever
busted me four grades before.

97
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:19,350
Get in here,
you idiot !

98
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:28,776
Come a little closer. I wanna get a
better look at ya.

99
00:09:36,367 --> 00:09:38,786
How's your skin, son ?

100
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:41,664
My skin, sir ?

101
00:09:41,706 --> 00:09:45,043
- Oh, for Christ's sake.
- I'm sorry, I don--

102
00:09:45,126 --> 00:09:48,755
Just call me Frank.
Call me Mr. Slade.

103
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:52,675
Call me Colonel, if you must.
Just don't call me sir.

104
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:55,720
All right, Colonel.

105
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,391
Simms, Charles.
A senior.

106
00:10:00,475 --> 00:10:03,937
- You on student aid, Simms ?
- Uh, yes, I am.

107
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:07,649
For "student aid"
read "crook."

108
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:10,360
Your father peddles car telephones
at a 300% markup.

109
00:10:10,401 --> 00:10:13,947
Your mother works on heavy commission
in a camera store.

110
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:16,908
Graduated to it
from espresso machines.

111
00:10:16,991 --> 00:10:18,618
Hah-hah !

112
00:10:23,206 --> 00:10:26,876
What are you, dying of
some wasting disease ?

113
00:10:28,253 --> 00:10:31,381
No, I'm right --
I'm right here.

114
00:10:31,422 --> 00:10:35,093
I know exactly where
your body is.

115
00:10:35,176 --> 00:10:39,097
What I'm lookin' for
is some indication of a brain.

116
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:42,142
Too much football
without a helmet ?

117
00:10:42,225 --> 00:10:46,896
Hah ! Lyndon's line
on Gerry Ford.

118
00:10:46,938 --> 00:10:50,650
Deputy Debriefer,
Paris Peace Talks, '68.

119
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:54,779
Snagged the Silver Star
and a silver bar. Threw me into G-2.

120
00:10:54,863 --> 00:10:56,823
G-2 ?

121
00:10:56,906 --> 00:11:00,076
Intelligence,
of which you have none.

122
00:11:03,204 --> 00:11:05,415
Where you from ?

123
00:11:05,456 --> 00:11:08,710
Um, Gresham, Oregon,

124
00:11:08,793 --> 00:11:10,712
s-- Colonel.

125
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:13,631
What does your daddy do
in Gresham, Oregon ?

126
00:11:13,715 --> 00:11:15,633
Hmm ? Count wood chips ?

127
00:11:17,218 --> 00:11:21,014
Uh, my stepfather and my mom
run a convenience store.

128
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:26,019
- How convenient ! What time they open ?
- 5:00 A.M.

129
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:28,438
- Close ?
- 1:00 A.M.

130
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,607
Hard workers.

131
00:11:30,648 --> 00:11:33,568
You got me all
misty-eyed !

132
00:11:36,237 --> 00:11:40,366
So, what are you doin' here
in this sparrow-fart town ?

133
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:42,577
I, l--
I attend Baird.

134
00:11:44,412 --> 00:11:47,248
Attend Baird !

135
00:11:47,332 --> 00:11:49,959
I know you go
to the Baird school.

136
00:11:50,001 --> 00:11:53,004
Point is,
how do you afford it,

137
00:11:53,046 --> 00:11:57,759
even with the student aid and
the folks back home hustlin' corn nuts ?

138
00:11:57,842 --> 00:12:02,639
I won a, uh,
Young America merit scholarship.

139
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:05,183
Whoo-ah !

140
00:12:06,434 --> 00:12:10,438
?Glory, glory
Hallelujah ?

141
00:12:10,522 --> 00:12:14,526
?Glory, glory
Hallelujah ?

142
00:12:17,362 --> 00:12:19,280
- Who's there ?

143
00:12:19,364 --> 00:12:22,951
- That little piece of tail ?

144
00:12:24,619 --> 00:12:26,955
Get her outta here !

145
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:38,550
Yeah.

146
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:42,053
Can't believe
they're my blood.

147
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:50,061
I.Q. of sloths and
the manners of banshees.

148
00:12:50,145 --> 00:12:52,689
He's a mechanic,
she's a homemaker.

149
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:55,150
He knows as much about cars
as a beauty queen,

150
00:12:55,233 --> 00:12:58,945
and she bakes cookies,
taste like wing nuts.

151
00:12:59,028 --> 00:13:02,574
As for the tots,
they're twits.

152
00:13:02,657 --> 00:13:05,368
How's your skin, son ?
I like my aides to be presentable.

153
00:13:08,746 --> 00:13:12,292
Well, I --
I've had a few zits.

154
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:17,839
Um, but my roommate, he lent me
his Clinique because he's from --

155
00:13:17,922 --> 00:13:20,091
"The History of My Skin,"
by Charles Simms.

156
00:13:21,885 --> 00:13:26,097
You patronizing me,
peewee ? Hmm ?

157
00:13:26,181 --> 00:13:29,309
You givin' me that old
prep school palaver ?

158
00:13:29,392 --> 00:13:32,145
Baird School !

159
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:35,607
A bunch of runny-nosed snots
in tweed jackets...

160
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:38,234
all studyin'
to be George Bush.

161
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:42,155
Well...

162
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:45,533
I believe President Bush
went to Andover, Colonel.

163
00:13:48,328 --> 00:13:50,663
You sharpshootin' me, punk ?

164
00:13:52,123 --> 00:13:54,125
Is that what you're doin' ?

165
00:13:54,209 --> 00:13:57,378
Don't you
sharpshoot me !

166
00:13:57,462 --> 00:13:59,923
You'll give me forty.

167
00:13:59,964 --> 00:14:02,467
Then you're gonna give me
forty more.

168
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:05,929
Then you're gonna pull K.P.,
the grease pit !

169
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:10,266
I'll rub your nose
in enlisted men's crud...

170
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:14,395
till you don't know which end is up !
You understand ?

171
00:14:14,479 --> 00:14:16,397
Yeah.

172
00:14:16,481 --> 00:14:19,901
- What do you want ?
- What do you mean, what do I want ?

173
00:14:19,984 --> 00:14:23,154
What do you want here ?

174
00:14:24,155 --> 00:14:26,616
I wa-want a job.

175
00:14:26,658 --> 00:14:28,493
A job !

176
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:30,745
Yeah, I want a job
so I can make, you know,

177
00:14:30,829 --> 00:14:33,581
my plane fare home
for Christmas.

178
00:14:33,665 --> 00:14:36,251
Oh.

179
00:14:36,334 --> 00:14:40,130
God, you're touching !

180
00:14:50,014 --> 00:14:53,059
?...from the banks ?

181
00:14:53,143 --> 00:14:56,521
?Of the
mighty Mississippi ?

182
00:14:56,563 --> 00:15:02,235
?Workin'
the whole night through ?

183
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:05,321
?Till the
riverboat gamblers ?

184
00:15:05,363 --> 00:15:08,366
?Stop to make a killin' ?

185
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:11,786
?Bring it on back to you §§

186
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:14,330
Still here, poormouth ?

187
00:15:14,372 --> 00:15:16,249
Hmm ?

188
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:21,754
Convenience store...
my ass !

189
00:15:21,838 --> 00:15:25,967
Hustlin' jalapeno dips
to the appleseeds.

190
00:15:27,093 --> 00:15:29,095
Go on.

191
00:15:29,179 --> 00:15:31,055
Dismissed.

192
00:15:33,683 --> 00:15:35,685
Dismissed !

193
00:15:40,565 --> 00:15:45,862
?Evangeline ?

194
00:15:45,904 --> 00:15:49,282
?Evangeline ?

195
00:15:49,407 --> 00:15:51,701
- Mrs. Rossi ?

196
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:55,538
Charlie, we're up here !
Come on up.

197
00:15:56,831 --> 00:15:59,042
- Uh, this is Donny.
- Hey, Charlie.

198
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:01,169
Hi.

199
00:16:01,252 --> 00:16:04,464
Uh, Mrs. Rossi,
I got the feelin' I screwed up.

200
00:16:04,547 --> 00:16:08,218
- Oh, you couldn't have.
- It was a bad interview.

201
00:16:08,259 --> 00:16:10,762
That was no interview, Charlie.
You're it.

202
00:16:10,804 --> 00:16:13,932
You're the only one that showed up.
You have to take the job.

203
00:16:14,015 --> 00:16:18,645
He sleeps a lot. You can
watch television, call your girlfriend.

204
00:16:18,728 --> 00:16:20,647
I promise you,
an easy 300 bucks.

205
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:24,651
I don't get
an easy feeling.

206
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:31,324
His bark is worse
than his bite.

207
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:34,744
He was a great soldier,
a real hero.

208
00:16:34,828 --> 00:16:37,914
The man grows on you !

209
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:42,085
By Sunday night,
you'll be best friends.

210
00:16:42,127 --> 00:16:45,713
Charlie, please.

211
00:16:45,797 --> 00:16:49,425
I want to get away for a few days,
and Uncle Frank won't come with us.

212
00:16:49,467 --> 00:16:53,054
Six months ago, he could
sometimes tell light from dark,

213
00:16:53,138 --> 00:16:55,431
but now there's nothing.

214
00:16:55,515 --> 00:17:00,270
I feel better having
someone else around just in case.

215
00:17:04,524 --> 00:17:06,442
Please ?

216
00:17:09,571 --> 00:17:12,115
Okay, Mrs. Rossi.
Sure.

217
00:17:12,198 --> 00:17:16,286
- Thank you, Charlie..
- Come here, you.

218
00:17:24,502 --> 00:17:26,463
There you go.

219
00:17:26,504 --> 00:17:29,466
Chas ! Chas, hold up !

220
00:17:30,633 --> 00:17:32,552
- How ya doin' ?
- I'm good.

221
00:17:32,635 --> 00:17:34,637
That's great.

222
00:17:34,721 --> 00:17:36,973
This can't go out.
This is on reserve.

223
00:17:40,185 --> 00:17:42,312
Here's the thing.

224
00:17:42,395 --> 00:17:45,815
I need the book tonight...

225
00:17:45,857 --> 00:17:49,611
- for a Thanksgiving quiz with
big-shit Preston in the morning.
- Yeah, I know.

226
00:17:49,694 --> 00:17:51,988
That's why he put it on reserve.
This is our only copy.

227
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:54,782
Chas, I'm pullin'
an all-nighter.

228
00:17:54,866 --> 00:17:59,579
Without that book
I'm dead, okay ?

229
00:17:59,662 --> 00:18:02,916
If it's not back by 7:30,
it's gonna be my ass.

230
00:18:02,999 --> 00:18:06,586
Oh, I promise.
I promise.

231
00:18:13,343 --> 00:18:15,845
- Got it ? ?
- Yeah.

232
00:18:29,859 --> 00:18:33,112
Just a second.
I gotta lock up.

233
00:18:37,408 --> 00:18:40,203
Okay.

234
00:18:40,286 --> 00:18:43,331
God, can you wait to get out
of this dump or what ?

235
00:18:48,711 --> 00:18:50,630
Where you guys
going skiing again ?

236
00:18:50,713 --> 00:18:53,842
- Sugarloaf or --
- It's bush, Chas, Sugarbush.

237
00:19:03,768 --> 00:19:06,729
That's my boys.
What are you doin' ?

238
00:19:06,813 --> 00:19:09,732
Keep your voice down !

239
00:19:09,774 --> 00:19:12,068
I'll tell you about it
in the morning.

240
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:15,655
- Shh.
- Wha--

241
00:19:17,574 --> 00:19:21,828
- Miss Hunsaker, have a nice day ?
- George, why all the noise ?

242
00:19:21,911 --> 00:19:24,873
It's hunsaker ! Go ! Go !

243
00:19:24,956 --> 00:19:27,459
I was just
messin' around with Chas.

244
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,544
- Good evening, Charles.
- Hi, Mrs. Hunsaker.

245
00:19:36,593 --> 00:19:38,595
- What was that ?
- I don't know, ma'am.

246
00:19:38,678 --> 00:19:42,056
- Who were those boys ?
What were they doing ?
- Oh, who knows ?

247
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:45,643
- Charles ?
- Um --

248
00:19:45,727 --> 00:19:49,481
- Did you make this scarf yourself ?
- No, George, I bought it.

249
00:19:49,564 --> 00:19:52,317
- 'Cause it's a beauty. It really is.
- Thank you, George.

250
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:55,111
In case I don't see you before
the Thanksgiving holidays,

251
00:19:55,195 --> 00:19:58,072
- why don't you give me
one of your big hugs ?
- Oh, George !

252
00:19:58,156 --> 00:20:00,116
- Please ? Come on.
- Good evening, boys.

253
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,619
Good-bye,
Mrs. Hunsaker.

254
00:20:21,805 --> 00:20:26,643
Mr. Trask is our fearless leader,

255
00:20:26,684 --> 00:20:31,439
a man of learning,
a voracious reader.

256
00:20:31,523 --> 00:20:35,944
He could recite the "Iliad"
in ancient greek...

257
00:20:36,027 --> 00:20:40,323
while fishing for trout
in a rippling creek.

258
00:20:40,406 --> 00:20:45,161
Endowed with wisdom,
of judgement sound,

259
00:20:45,203 --> 00:20:49,916
nevertheless about him
the questions abound.

260
00:20:53,545 --> 00:20:58,967
How does Mr. Trask
make such wonderful deals ?

261
00:20:59,050 --> 00:21:03,138
Why did the trustees
buy him Jaguar wheels ?

262
00:21:03,221 --> 00:21:05,431
He wasn't conniving !

263
00:21:05,515 --> 00:21:08,768
He wasn't crass !

264
00:21:08,852 --> 00:21:12,230
He merely
puckered his lips...

265
00:21:13,439 --> 00:21:17,402
and kissed their ass !

266
00:21:33,418 --> 00:21:36,379
Come on.
Come on.

267
00:21:41,384 --> 00:21:43,720
One more !
One more, come on !

268
00:21:54,772 --> 00:21:56,399
Aah !

269
00:22:03,156 --> 00:22:04,949
Fuck you !

270
00:22:11,789 --> 00:22:15,794
Mr. Simms, Mr. Willis.

271
00:22:15,877 --> 00:22:18,338
Hmm.

272
00:22:18,421 --> 00:22:22,634
Mrs. Hunsaker says that you gentlemen
were at a vantage point last night...

273
00:22:22,717 --> 00:22:26,304
to observe who was
responsible for this, uh,

274
00:22:26,387 --> 00:22:28,932
stunt.

275
00:22:33,186 --> 00:22:36,272
Who was it ?

276
00:22:36,356 --> 00:22:39,442
I really couldn't
tell you, sir.

277
00:22:39,526 --> 00:22:43,780
Um, I thought I saw someone
fooling with the lamppost,

278
00:22:43,822 --> 00:22:48,284
but by the time I pulled focus,
they were gone.

279
00:22:48,326 --> 00:22:52,121
Mr. Simms ?

280
00:22:52,205 --> 00:22:54,123
I couldn't say.

281
00:22:56,167 --> 00:23:00,171
That automobile is not
just a possession of mine.

282
00:23:00,255 --> 00:23:05,051
That automobile was presented
to me by the Board of Trustees.

283
00:23:05,135 --> 00:23:10,348
It is a symbol of the standard
of excellence for which
this school is known,

284
00:23:10,431 --> 00:23:13,434
and I will not
have it tarnished.

285
00:23:13,518 --> 00:23:15,478
The automobile ?

286
00:23:17,438 --> 00:23:19,566
The standard,
Mr. Willis.

287
00:23:23,111 --> 00:23:27,323
- What's your position, Mr. Simms ?
- On what, sir ?

288
00:23:27,365 --> 00:23:29,659
On preserving the
reputation of Baird.

289
00:23:29,701 --> 00:23:33,580
- I-I'm for Baird.
- Then, who did it ?

290
00:23:35,206 --> 00:23:37,542
I really couldn't say for sure.

291
00:23:43,047 --> 00:23:45,008
Very well.

292
00:23:51,890 --> 00:23:54,309
First thing Monday,
I'm convening a special session...

293
00:23:54,392 --> 00:23:56,853
of the student-faculty
disciplinary committee.

294
00:23:56,895 --> 00:23:59,481
As this is a matter which
concerns the whole school,

295
00:23:59,564 --> 00:24:02,525
the entire student body
will be present.

296
00:24:02,567 --> 00:24:05,236
There will be no classes,
no activities.

297
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:07,447
Nothing will transpire
at this institution...

298
00:24:07,530 --> 00:24:10,450
until that proceeding
is concluded.

299
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:16,664
And if, at that time,
we are no further along than we are now,

300
00:24:18,249 --> 00:24:21,419
I will expel you both.

301
00:24:25,507 --> 00:24:28,510
Mr. Willis,
would you excuse us ?

302
00:24:31,721 --> 00:24:35,433
Have a nice Thanksgiving.

303
00:24:35,517 --> 00:24:37,477
Thank you.
You too, Mr. Willis.

304
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:39,479
I will.

305
00:24:46,653 --> 00:24:48,947
Mr. Simms.

306
00:24:48,988 --> 00:24:52,742
I'm not quite through
with you yet.

307
00:25:01,459 --> 00:25:04,879
One of the few perks
of this office is that...

308
00:25:04,963 --> 00:25:10,301
I am empowered to handle
certain matters on my own as I see fit.

309
00:25:10,343 --> 00:25:12,303
Do you understand ?

310
00:25:12,345 --> 00:25:14,889
- Yes, sir.
- Good.

311
00:25:14,973 --> 00:25:18,101
The Dean of Admissions at Harvard
and I have an arrangement.

312
00:25:18,184 --> 00:25:21,479
Along with the usual sheaf of applicants
submitted by Baird,

313
00:25:21,521 --> 00:25:23,606
of which virtually,

314
00:25:23,648 --> 00:25:27,277
oh, two-thirds are
guaranteed admittance,

315
00:25:27,318 --> 00:25:30,780
I add one name,

316
00:25:30,864 --> 00:25:34,826
somebody who's a standout
and yet, underprivileged;

317
00:25:34,909 --> 00:25:40,748
a student who cannot afford to pay
the board and tuition in Cambridge.

318
00:25:42,625 --> 00:25:46,296
Do you know on whose behalf
I drafted a memo this year ?

319
00:25:46,379 --> 00:25:51,843
- No, sir.
- You. You, Mr. Simms.

320
00:25:55,138 --> 00:25:57,348
Now can you tell me
who did it ?

321
00:25:59,893 --> 00:26:01,811
No, sir, I can't.

322
00:26:03,104 --> 00:26:05,899
You take the weekend
to think about it, Mr. Simms.

323
00:26:08,276 --> 00:26:11,404
Good afternoon.

324
00:26:12,822 --> 00:26:15,116
What'd he say ?

325
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,368
- Nothin'.
- What do you mean, nothing ?

326
00:26:17,452 --> 00:26:19,787
He said the same thing.
He just said it over.

327
00:26:19,871 --> 00:26:21,915
You know what
he's doing ?

328
00:26:21,998 --> 00:26:25,210
He's good-cop,
bad-coppin' us.

329
00:26:25,251 --> 00:26:27,504
He knows I'm old guard.
You're fringe.

330
00:26:27,545 --> 00:26:31,090
He's gonna bear down on me
and soft-soap you.

331
00:26:31,174 --> 00:26:35,887
Did he try to soft-soap you ? Did he ?

332
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:38,515
No.

333
00:26:38,598 --> 00:26:41,684
Chas, I detect a slight panic pulse
from you. Are you panicking ?

334
00:26:41,726 --> 00:26:44,187
- Yeah, a little.
- Come on.

335
00:26:44,229 --> 00:26:47,607
- You're on scholarship, right ?
- Yeah.

336
00:26:47,690 --> 00:26:52,320
You're on scholarship
from Oregon... at Baird.

337
00:26:52,403 --> 00:26:55,365
You're a long way from home, Chas.

338
00:26:55,406 --> 00:26:57,742
What's that got to do
with anything ?

339
00:26:57,784 --> 00:27:00,078
I don't know how
it works out there.

340
00:27:00,161 --> 00:27:03,706
But how it works here ?
We stick together.

341
00:27:03,748 --> 00:27:06,209
It's us against them,
no matter what.

342
00:27:06,251 --> 00:27:10,213
We don't cover our ass.
We don't tell our parents.

343
00:27:10,296 --> 00:27:13,007
Stonewall everybody !

344
00:27:13,091 --> 00:27:17,720
And above all,
never, never...

345
00:27:17,762 --> 00:27:21,432
Leave any of us
twisting in the wind.

346
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:24,519
And that's it.

347
00:27:24,602 --> 00:27:27,021
What does that have to do
with me being on scholarship ?

348
00:27:27,105 --> 00:27:29,399
Hey, hey !

349
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:32,944
I'm just tryin' to bring you
up to speed, kid, that's it.

350
00:27:33,027 --> 00:27:35,780
Thanks.

351
00:27:37,323 --> 00:27:41,661
I'll tell you what. Give me a few hours
to figure out the moves,

352
00:27:41,744 --> 00:27:45,165
and call me tonight
in Vermont.

353
00:27:45,248 --> 00:27:48,501
I'll be at the Sugarbush lodge,
all right ?

354
00:27:48,585 --> 00:27:51,171
All right.

355
00:27:51,254 --> 00:27:53,715
You all right ?

356
00:27:53,798 --> 00:27:56,759
Yeah, I guess so.

357
00:27:56,801 --> 00:27:59,387
Okay.

358
00:28:00,805 --> 00:28:03,057
Try to keep him down
to four drinks a day.

359
00:28:03,141 --> 00:28:05,977
If you can keep him down to forty,
you're doin' good.

360
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:09,564
Try to water them down a little.
Do you know how to do that ?

361
00:28:09,647 --> 00:28:14,152
- It's a long ride, honey !
- Get the bags in the car.
I'll be right out.

362
00:28:14,235 --> 00:28:18,531
Mommy, Mommy !
Don't forget Uncle Frank's walk.

363
00:28:18,615 --> 00:28:20,700
Oh, ha... Yeah.

364
00:28:20,783 --> 00:28:24,454
Uh, you have to
air him out...

365
00:28:24,496 --> 00:28:26,831
a little every day.

366
00:28:26,915 --> 00:28:30,084
Why don't you go on back there,
get yourself oriented ?

367
00:28:30,168 --> 00:28:34,756
I'll come out in a minute,
give you telephone numbers and stuff.

368
00:28:34,839 --> 00:28:37,383
Well, I wouldn't try
a thing like that...

369
00:28:37,467 --> 00:28:39,928
unless I knew,
would I ?

370
00:28:40,011 --> 00:28:41,930
Just let me
speak to her.

371
00:28:42,013 --> 00:28:43,932
Hello, beautiful.
Is that you ?

372
00:28:44,015 --> 00:28:47,060
Yeah,
we spoke yesterday.

373
00:28:47,143 --> 00:28:49,979
You have a glass of wine
with lunch ?

374
00:28:50,021 --> 00:28:53,608
You sound
a little dusky. Hmm.

375
00:28:53,691 --> 00:28:57,570
- Just a minute, sweetheart.

376
00:28:57,654 --> 00:29:01,199
You're back, huh ?

377
00:29:01,282 --> 00:29:02,826
Tenacious !

378
00:29:02,867 --> 00:29:06,287
Get out my dress blues.
They're in a garment bag in the closet.

379
00:29:06,371 --> 00:29:08,414
Check the top dresser drawer.
Take out the shoulder boards...

380
00:29:08,498 --> 00:29:10,542
and affix them
shoulders right and left,

381
00:29:10,625 --> 00:29:13,169
A.S.A.P.
That means now.

382
00:29:13,253 --> 00:29:15,213
Hello.

383
00:29:15,255 --> 00:29:18,550
Sorry to keep you
waitin', sweetheart.

384
00:29:18,591 --> 00:29:21,094
I'm not the kind of guy
who likes to rush things,

385
00:29:21,177 --> 00:29:26,891
but I'm catchin' a 4:00
at Logan, lookin' out my window,
and there's not a taxi in sight.

386
00:29:26,975 --> 00:29:29,310
What happened to Chet ?

387
00:29:29,394 --> 00:29:31,437
He didn't invest
in a radio yet ?

388
00:29:31,521 --> 00:29:34,732
Hah ! Well,
get your driver on it.

389
00:29:34,816 --> 00:29:38,444
Tell him to get
a move on.

390
00:29:38,528 --> 00:29:41,322
Yes. Mmm.

391
00:29:41,406 --> 00:29:45,660
Some kind of body has got to go
with that bedroom voice.

392
00:29:45,743 --> 00:29:48,204
One day I'm gonna swing by,
get a better look at it.

393
00:29:48,288 --> 00:29:50,957
You bet.

394
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:52,959
Bye.

395
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:59,466
My val-pak's underneath the bed.
Get it out.

396
00:29:59,549 --> 00:30:01,551
Put the boards on the blues
and fold 'em in.

397
00:30:01,634 --> 00:30:05,221
Uh, are we going someplace,
Colonel ?

398
00:30:05,305 --> 00:30:08,683
What business is that of yours ?
Don't shrug, imbecile.

399
00:30:08,766 --> 00:30:13,730
I'm blind. Save your body language
for the bimbi.

400
00:30:13,771 --> 00:30:18,651
- Now, get my gear out.
- Francine, get in the car.

401
00:30:18,735 --> 00:30:23,031
It's almost 3:00. The goddamn
Flintstones haven't left yet.

402
00:30:23,114 --> 00:30:28,161
Willie Rossi
must go in the car !

403
00:30:28,244 --> 00:30:31,956
- Here comes Mrs. Rossi now.
- Damn it !

404
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:35,418
She said good-bye to me
three times today.

405
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:37,629
What's she got,
separation anxiety ?

406
00:30:37,712 --> 00:30:40,715
Cut her off
at the door !

407
00:30:42,133 --> 00:30:44,761
Hi, honey.
Bye, honey.

408
00:30:47,347 --> 00:30:49,766
I wish you were
coming with us.

409
00:30:49,849 --> 00:30:52,101
Me too.

410
00:30:52,185 --> 00:30:54,813
Maybe next time.

411
00:30:58,441 --> 00:31:00,985
- Drive carefully now.
- Yeah.

412
00:31:03,196 --> 00:31:06,449
Charlie, this is
where we'll be.

413
00:31:06,491 --> 00:31:09,202
Good luck, Charlie.
Don't let him drink too much.

414
00:31:11,554 --> 00:31:15,808
See ya, Charlie !

415
00:31:15,892 --> 00:31:19,562
And no 900 numbers.
He loves to talk dirty.

416
00:31:26,569 --> 00:31:29,489
All right,
let's get to work.

417
00:31:38,456 --> 00:31:41,084
L-buckles
givin' you trouble ?

418
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:44,754
Never in the Boy Scouts,
sluggo ?

419
00:31:44,796 --> 00:31:48,424
- I, I made Tenderfoot.
- Tenderfoot, my foot !

420
00:31:48,508 --> 00:31:50,802
Convenience-store
mama's boy.

421
00:31:50,885 --> 00:31:53,054
Here. Let me
take a look at that.

422
00:31:53,096 --> 00:31:57,016
Touch me again, I'll kill ya,
you little son-of-a-bitch !

423
00:31:58,935 --> 00:32:03,439
I touch you.
Understand ?

424
00:32:05,650 --> 00:32:09,737
My shoulder boards are in
the top dresser drawer. Get them, son.

425
00:32:09,779 --> 00:32:13,992
The epaulets with
the silver oak leaf.

426
00:32:30,133 --> 00:32:33,094
- Are these --
- Good.

427
00:32:33,136 --> 00:32:35,638
Taxi come yet ?

428
00:32:35,722 --> 00:32:38,099
Colonel,
where are we going ?

429
00:32:38,141 --> 00:32:40,101
Where we going ?

430
00:32:40,143 --> 00:32:42,604
Freak show central.

431
00:32:42,645 --> 00:32:45,481
- Where's that ?
- New York City.

432
00:32:47,358 --> 00:32:49,903
That's in New York, son.
New York State.

433
00:32:49,986 --> 00:32:54,324
Uh, Mrs. Rossi didn't say anything to me
about going anywhere.

434
00:32:54,365 --> 00:32:56,534
She forgot.

435
00:32:56,618 --> 00:32:59,662
- Should we call her, 'cause I --
- You kidding me ?

436
00:32:59,746 --> 00:33:03,541
Call her ? By the time they get to
Albany in that "hupmobile" he drives...

437
00:33:03,625 --> 00:33:06,336
it'll be opening day
at Saratoga.

438
00:33:06,419 --> 00:33:10,423
- Colonel, I can't go to New York City.
- Why not ?

439
00:33:10,506 --> 00:33:12,508
New York --

440
00:33:12,592 --> 00:33:16,262
- New York's too much responsibility.
- Ah, responsibility !

441
00:33:16,346 --> 00:33:19,057
I had a lot of 17 year olds
my first platoon.

442
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:22,477
I took care of them.
All set !

443
00:33:23,728 --> 00:33:26,481
How do I look ?

444
00:33:26,522 --> 00:33:29,317
Tickets. Money.

445
00:33:29,359 --> 00:33:31,319
Speech.

446
00:33:31,361 --> 00:33:34,989
Old Washington joke...
from my days with Lyndon.

447
00:33:35,073 --> 00:33:38,993
--I knew I could count on transportation.

448
00:33:39,035 --> 00:33:41,913
Are you ready ?

449
00:33:43,122 --> 00:33:46,542
This is not Panmunjom.
A simple yes will do.

450
00:33:46,584 --> 00:33:48,670
- Um --
- Good ! Here you go.

451
00:33:48,711 --> 00:33:51,589
Come on !
Hup to it, son !

452
00:33:51,673 --> 00:33:54,300
You're in front of me.
Let's go.

453
00:33:54,384 --> 00:33:57,845
- Tomster, come here, boy.

454
00:33:57,887 --> 00:34:00,473
Psst, psst.
Come on.

455
00:34:00,556 --> 00:34:04,561
Here, tomster, come on.
Tomster, tomster. Yeah.

456
00:34:05,895 --> 00:34:10,858
Remember, when in doubt... fuck.

457
00:34:13,945 --> 00:34:16,531
Good afternoon, sir.
Where's our destination ?

458
00:34:16,614 --> 00:34:19,534
Our destination... New York City,
home of the brave !

459
00:34:19,576 --> 00:34:22,704
- Two for the shuttle to New York.
- I'm not shuttling anywhere.

460
00:34:22,787 --> 00:34:26,583
- Look at those tickets. "First class."
- Yes, sir, first class.

461
00:34:26,666 --> 00:34:30,461
You bought me a ticket ?
I never said I'd go to New York.

462
00:34:30,545 --> 00:34:34,716
What are you, some kind of chicken-shit,
sticks to job description only ?

463
00:34:34,757 --> 00:34:36,718
Gate 46, sir.

464
00:34:36,759 --> 00:34:39,596
- As you were, son.
- Thank you, sir.

465
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:42,223
Which way's the door ?

466
00:34:42,265 --> 00:34:46,352
- Are you blind ? Are you blind ?
- Of course not.

467
00:34:46,436 --> 00:34:49,689
Then why do you keep grabbin'
my goddamn arm ?

468
00:34:49,772 --> 00:34:53,151
I take your arm.

469
00:34:56,446 --> 00:34:58,489
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be sorry.

470
00:34:58,573 --> 00:35:01,242
How would you know,
watchin' MTV all your life ?

471
00:35:01,451 --> 00:35:03,786
Yes !

472
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:07,916
- Jack Daniels...
- You bet.

473
00:35:09,959 --> 00:35:13,212
- And Diet Slice.
- The old Diet Slice.

474
00:35:13,296 --> 00:35:15,590
- And a water.
- Thank you, Daphne.

475
00:35:15,632 --> 00:35:17,550
Certainly, sir.

476
00:35:22,555 --> 00:35:24,599
Ahh ! Mmm !

477
00:35:24,682 --> 00:35:28,519
How did you know her name ?

478
00:35:28,603 --> 00:35:31,981
Well, she's
wearin' Floris.

479
00:35:32,023 --> 00:35:35,235
That's an
English cologne.

480
00:35:35,318 --> 00:35:39,364
But her voice is
California chickie.

481
00:35:39,447 --> 00:35:43,326
Now, California chickie
bucking for English lady --

482
00:35:43,409 --> 00:35:47,038
I call her Daphne.

483
00:35:47,121 --> 00:35:51,626
Oh, big things may happen to
that little thing of yours.

484
00:35:53,044 --> 00:35:55,964
Look, Colonel,

485
00:35:56,005 --> 00:35:58,258
- I'll get you to New York, all right ?
- Uh-huh.

486
00:35:58,341 --> 00:36:01,678
Then I'm gonna have
to turn around and come back.

487
00:36:01,761 --> 00:36:04,889
Well, Chuck, you gotta do
what you gotta do.

488
00:36:04,973 --> 00:36:08,142
Charlie, all right ?
Or Charles.

489
00:36:08,184 --> 00:36:10,478
Sorry.
I can't blame you, though.

490
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:12,564
Chuck is a --

491
00:36:15,567 --> 00:36:18,278
So, why are we
going to New York ?

492
00:36:18,361 --> 00:36:21,906
All information will be given
on a need-to-know basis.

493
00:36:23,741 --> 00:36:25,702
Whoo-ah !

494
00:36:25,743 --> 00:36:27,954
Where's Daphne ?
Let's get her down here.

495
00:36:30,206 --> 00:36:32,166
She's in the back.

496
00:36:32,208 --> 00:36:35,795
A tail's in the tail.

497
00:36:35,878 --> 00:36:37,839
Hah !

498
00:36:37,922 --> 00:36:41,050
Oh, but I still smell her.

499
00:36:43,386 --> 00:36:45,888
Women !

500
00:36:45,972 --> 00:36:49,058
What can you say ?

501
00:36:49,142 --> 00:36:51,728
Who made 'em ?

502
00:36:51,811 --> 00:36:53,938
God must have been
a fuckin' genius.

503
00:36:58,735 --> 00:37:01,362
The hair --

504
00:37:01,404 --> 00:37:05,533
They say the hair
is everything, you know.

505
00:37:05,617 --> 00:37:09,704
Have you ever buried your nose
in a mountain of curls...

506
00:37:09,787 --> 00:37:14,626
and just wanted
to go to sleep forever ?

507
00:37:14,709 --> 00:37:18,421
Or lips --

508
00:37:18,504 --> 00:37:20,548
and when they touched,
yours were like...

509
00:37:20,632 --> 00:37:24,385
that first swallow
of wine...

510
00:37:24,427 --> 00:37:26,763
after you just crossed
the desert.

511
00:37:30,391 --> 00:37:33,937
Tits ! Whoo-ah !

512
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:37,398
Big ones, little ones,

513
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:39,859
nipples staring
right out at ya...

514
00:37:39,943 --> 00:37:42,904
Like secret searchlights.

515
00:37:42,946 --> 00:37:45,865
Mmm.

516
00:37:46,783 --> 00:37:49,577
And legs --

517
00:37:49,619 --> 00:37:52,914
I don't care if
they're Greek columns...

518
00:37:52,956 --> 00:37:56,417
or secondhand Steinways.

519
00:37:56,459 --> 00:37:59,837
What's between 'em,

520
00:37:59,921 --> 00:38:02,423
passport to heaven.

521
00:38:03,216 --> 00:38:05,260
I need a drink.

522
00:38:08,972 --> 00:38:12,267
Yes, Mr. Simms,

523
00:38:12,308 --> 00:38:17,272
there's only two syllables
in this whole wide world worth hearing:

524
00:38:21,192 --> 00:38:23,152
pussy.

525
00:38:23,987 --> 00:38:25,905
Hah !

526
00:38:25,989 --> 00:38:29,117
Are you listening to me, son ?
I'm givin' you pearls here.

527
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:32,996
I guess you
really like women.

528
00:38:33,037 --> 00:38:36,666
Oh, above all things !

529
00:38:41,504 --> 00:38:45,174
A very, very
distant second...

530
00:38:46,968 --> 00:38:49,762
is a Ferrari.

531
00:38:55,977 --> 00:38:58,980
Charlie ?

532
00:38:59,063 --> 00:39:01,232
Give me your hand.

533
00:39:03,443 --> 00:39:06,571
This is just the start
of your education, son.

534
00:39:22,337 --> 00:39:24,297
Whoo-ah !

535
00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:27,383
- Where are we ?
- Where are we, eh ?

536
00:39:27,467 --> 00:39:30,803
The cynosure of
all things civilized:

537
00:39:30,887 --> 00:39:32,931
the Waldorf-Astoria.

538
00:39:33,014 --> 00:39:37,393
The last time I was here, Charlie,
was with a G-2 from Brussels.

539
00:39:37,477 --> 00:39:39,395
Had a Ferrari.

540
00:39:39,479 --> 00:39:42,607
Every day I held the door
open for the fucker.

541
00:39:42,690 --> 00:39:44,692
Never even offered me
a ride.

542
00:39:44,776 --> 00:39:46,736
Well, fuck him.

543
00:39:46,778 --> 00:39:49,197
He's dead and I'm blind.

544
00:39:52,951 --> 00:39:55,245
- Spread the word.
- Thank you, sir.

545
00:39:55,286 --> 00:39:58,873
- The intelligence will be forthcoming ?
- Sir ?

546
00:39:58,915 --> 00:40:00,917
On the escort scene.

547
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,503
Um, yes, sir.

548
00:40:03,586 --> 00:40:07,090
- And welcome to the Waldorf.
- Gracias, amigo.

549
00:40:08,591 --> 00:40:12,053
Puerto Ricans...
always made the best infantrymen.

550
00:40:17,809 --> 00:40:21,604
- Oh !

551
00:40:27,610 --> 00:40:29,946
I'm home again.

552
00:40:30,029 --> 00:40:33,157
Give me an inventory
on this, will you ?

553
00:40:38,371 --> 00:40:40,540
All right,
where am l, in Asia ?

554
00:40:40,623 --> 00:40:43,501
He told me the phone was on
the other side of the room, didn't he ?

555
00:40:43,585 --> 00:40:46,296
By the windows ?

556
00:40:46,337 --> 00:40:49,340
It's right here.

557
00:40:49,424 --> 00:40:51,467
Okay.

558
00:40:51,551 --> 00:40:53,886
We're in business.

559
00:40:57,807 --> 00:40:59,976
Get me the Oak Room.

560
00:41:00,018 --> 00:41:02,186
How's that inventory
comin' ?

561
00:41:04,147 --> 00:41:09,152
Uh, there's Jim Beam
and Early Times.

562
00:41:09,235 --> 00:41:12,155
Quartermaster's on the take again.
Hello.

563
00:41:12,196 --> 00:41:16,159
Is Sheldon or Mack there ?

564
00:41:16,242 --> 00:41:18,661
This is
Lt. Col. Frank Slade.

565
00:41:18,745 --> 00:41:24,500
I used to be a regular. I used
to come in with a General Garbisch.

566
00:41:24,584 --> 00:41:28,004
Yes, that's probably because
he's at Arlington six feet under.

567
00:41:28,046 --> 00:41:32,383
Listen up. I want a table for two, and
I don't mean Siberia, 8:15.

568
00:41:33,843 --> 00:41:36,387
Clear them little
bottles off.

569
00:41:36,471 --> 00:41:39,557
And when I get off the phone,
call up Hyman.

570
00:41:39,641 --> 00:41:42,560
Tell him I want it
wall to wall with John Daniels.

571
00:41:42,644 --> 00:41:45,813
Uh, don't you mean,
uh, Jack Daniels ?

572
00:41:45,855 --> 00:41:49,609
He may be Jack to you, son. But when
you've known him as long as I have --

573
00:41:49,692 --> 00:41:51,194
That's a joke.
Hello !

574
00:41:51,277 --> 00:41:55,657
This is Lt. Col. Frank Slade.
I would like a limo, 8:00.

575
00:42:01,704 --> 00:42:03,831
What are you drinkin' ?

576
00:42:03,873 --> 00:42:07,585
Uh, nothing, thanks.
I don't use it.

577
00:42:07,669 --> 00:42:10,672
What's useful about it ?

578
00:42:10,755 --> 00:42:14,550
I don't know. Listen, Colonel,
I have to get going.

579
00:42:14,592 --> 00:42:16,678
Where you goin' ?

580
00:42:16,761 --> 00:42:20,515
Back to school. I've got some real
important stuff I have to take care of.

581
00:42:22,225 --> 00:42:24,686
Very well.

582
00:42:24,727 --> 00:42:27,897
But I never let my aides leave
on an empty stomach.

583
00:42:27,981 --> 00:42:31,067
You'll dine with me and then my driver
will transport you...

584
00:42:31,150 --> 00:42:34,696
to the airport for the Boston Shuttle
departing at 2200 hours.

585
00:42:36,197 --> 00:42:39,576
Meanwhile,
unpack my bag.

586
00:42:39,659 --> 00:42:41,744
I'm gonna christen
the latrine.

587
00:42:43,246 --> 00:42:45,415
What's your name,
driver ?

588
00:42:45,498 --> 00:42:48,167
- Manny, sir.
- Manny.

589
00:42:48,251 --> 00:42:51,879
The bellhops at the Waldorf, are they
any good at getting escorts ?

590
00:42:51,921 --> 00:42:55,550
- I wouldn't know, sir.
- What would you know ?

591
00:42:55,592 --> 00:42:59,095
- About what ?
- About you-know-what ?

592
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:03,099
Maybe I could
manage something.

593
00:43:03,182 --> 00:43:06,311
I'm talkin''
top of the line, now.

594
00:43:06,394 --> 00:43:08,646
Let me think
about this, sir.

595
00:43:16,279 --> 00:43:18,323
What's the matter
with you ?

596
00:43:18,406 --> 00:43:23,202
- With me ?
- Yeah. Car feels heavy. You know why ?

597
00:43:23,286 --> 00:43:26,789
You got the fuckin' weight of the world
on your shoulders.

598
00:43:30,585 --> 00:43:33,004
I got a little problem
at school, that's all.

599
00:43:33,087 --> 00:43:36,007
- Spit it out !
- It's not a big deal, all right ?

600
00:43:36,090 --> 00:43:38,009
Where we going,
the Oak Room or somethin' ?

601
00:43:38,092 --> 00:43:40,762
If it's not a big deal, why did you say
"real important stuff" ?

602
00:43:40,803 --> 00:43:45,016
What are you doin', banging
the dean's daughter ? Hah !

603
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:50,313
- I'm just in a little trouble.
- What kind of trouble ?

604
00:43:50,396 --> 00:43:53,608
I saw some guys
doing something.

605
00:43:54,943 --> 00:43:58,321
To tell or not to tell,
or it's your ass.

606
00:43:58,404 --> 00:44:00,323
Hmm ?

607
00:44:02,408 --> 00:44:04,535
- How'd you know that ?
- I'm a wizard.

608
00:44:04,619 --> 00:44:07,163
Give me the details,
come on.

609
00:44:12,710 --> 00:44:14,796
There's this guy
at school named Harry.

610
00:44:14,837 --> 00:44:16,965
He's this real rich kid.

611
00:44:17,006 --> 00:44:19,217
He like...
runs the show.

612
00:44:19,300 --> 00:44:21,928
Who else ?

613
00:44:22,011 --> 00:44:26,224
There's another guy, George,
but George didn't do anything.

614
00:44:26,307 --> 00:44:30,186
George and I saw Harry and his buddies
doin' somethin'.

615
00:44:30,270 --> 00:44:32,313
Now, the folks at Baird,

616
00:44:32,397 --> 00:44:35,525
they know you and George can
identify the guilty parties ?

617
00:44:38,444 --> 00:44:40,530
Yeah, they think we can.

618
00:44:40,613 --> 00:44:45,368
- George is a friend of yours.
- He's not a friend, but he's all right.

619
00:44:45,410 --> 00:44:49,038
- You trust him ?
- Yeah, I guess so.

620
00:44:49,122 --> 00:44:54,043
- He's on scholarship too ?
- No, why ?

621
00:44:54,127 --> 00:44:57,505
We got George, we got Harry,
we got trouble.

622
00:44:57,547 --> 00:45:00,383
They're rich, you're poor.
You wanna get rich.

623
00:45:00,466 --> 00:45:03,845
You wanna graduate Baird,
become a rich big shot like them.

624
00:45:03,886 --> 00:45:07,015
- Am I right ?
- No. It's not that way at all.

625
00:45:07,098 --> 00:45:09,309
Okay, Charlie !

626
00:45:11,185 --> 00:45:13,688
the Oak Room.

627
00:45:13,730 --> 00:45:16,149
The Oak Room !

628
00:45:16,274 --> 00:45:19,152
Bring us a menu and double Jack Daniels
on the rocks.

629
00:45:19,193 --> 00:45:21,154
Charlie, sit down here.

630
00:45:21,195 --> 00:45:25,158
Uh, perhaps you'll feel more
comfortable in this, sir.

631
00:45:29,287 --> 00:45:32,624
You look great !

632
00:45:37,128 --> 00:45:39,672
Thank you.

633
00:45:39,756 --> 00:45:42,926
the Oak Room.

634
00:45:43,009 --> 00:45:46,137
Now, read me
the bill of fare.

635
00:45:46,220 --> 00:45:48,806
Uh, let's see.

636
00:45:48,890 --> 00:45:51,893
You got the Oak Room Burger
and fries for $24.

637
00:45:51,976 --> 00:45:55,230
Where's the booze ?
Flowin' like mud around here.

638
00:45:55,313 --> 00:45:57,315
A $24 hamburger ?

639
00:45:57,398 --> 00:45:59,567
W-What's the story ?

640
00:45:59,651 --> 00:46:02,487
What story ?

641
00:46:02,528 --> 00:46:06,366
- Are you a rich miser or something ?
- Hah !

642
00:46:06,407 --> 00:46:08,952
No, I'm just your average
blind man.

643
00:46:09,035 --> 00:46:11,663
Your average blind man.

644
00:46:11,704 --> 00:46:14,874
How do you plan on
paying for all this stuff ?

645
00:46:14,958 --> 00:46:18,419
Crisp, clean dollars...
American.

646
00:46:18,503 --> 00:46:20,463
I saved up my
disability checks.

647
00:46:20,546 --> 00:46:23,633
How much did you save ?
I mean, we flew first class,

648
00:46:23,716 --> 00:46:27,053
we're at the Waldorf-Astoria,
a $24 hamburger restaurant.

649
00:46:27,095 --> 00:46:30,974
- All part of a plan, Charlie.
- You want to let me in on it ?

650
00:46:31,057 --> 00:46:33,685
Why should I ? You're not interested.
You don't give a shit !

651
00:46:33,726 --> 00:46:38,106
You're leavin' on that
last shuttle out of La Guardia.

652
00:46:38,189 --> 00:46:41,734
Hmm ? Ooh !

653
00:46:41,818 --> 00:46:44,487
You got 15 minutes, son. I don't think
you're gonna make it,

654
00:46:44,571 --> 00:46:49,993
unless the Oak Room keeps some
complimentary helicopter on the roof.

655
00:46:50,076 --> 00:46:52,787
No, sir. No !

656
00:46:52,870 --> 00:46:54,789
You're here till tomorrow.

657
00:46:56,332 --> 00:46:58,543
You said the last shuttle
leaves at 2200 hours.

658
00:46:58,585 --> 00:47:00,545
That's 10:00, right ?

659
00:47:00,587 --> 00:47:03,006
Last I heard, yeah.

660
00:47:03,089 --> 00:47:05,300
It's only 8:30.

661
00:47:05,383 --> 00:47:07,844
I lied. Leaves at 9:00.

662
00:47:07,927 --> 00:47:12,682
- It leaves at 9:00 ?
- Calm down. Calm down.

663
00:47:14,100 --> 00:47:17,520
Ahh ! The truth is, Charlie,

664
00:47:19,105 --> 00:47:23,943
- I need a guide dog
to help me execute my plan.
- What plan ?

665
00:47:25,111 --> 00:47:27,739
You have a right to know.

666
00:47:29,449 --> 00:47:32,660
It's not really a plan, Charlie.
It's sort of a --

667
00:47:32,744 --> 00:47:35,371
more like a tour,

668
00:47:35,455 --> 00:47:38,333
a little tour of pleasures:

669
00:47:38,416 --> 00:47:43,004
stay in a first-class hotel,
eat an agreeable meal,

670
00:47:43,087 --> 00:47:46,215
drink a nice glass of wine,

671
00:47:46,299 --> 00:47:48,468
see my big brother.

672
00:47:48,551 --> 00:47:51,220
Nothing like family,
you know.

673
00:47:51,304 --> 00:47:55,266
And then, make love
to a terrific woman.

674
00:47:57,143 --> 00:47:59,729
After that...

675
00:48:04,192 --> 00:48:06,069
Yeah ?

676
00:48:08,696 --> 00:48:13,243
I'm gonna lie down on my big,
beautiful bed at the Waldorf...

677
00:48:13,326 --> 00:48:15,954
and blow my brains out.

678
00:48:18,831 --> 00:48:21,960
- May I tell you our specials ?
- You may, sir.

679
00:48:22,043 --> 00:48:26,881
Tonight we have charred venison with
buckwheat spaetzle and green peppercorn.

680
00:48:26,965 --> 00:48:30,635
Grilled veal, tomato tapenade,
and roasted eggplants.

681
00:48:30,677 --> 00:48:32,637
Get me a napkin.
My mouth's watering.

682
00:48:32,679 --> 00:48:37,976
If you like our souffle for dessert,
it would be good to order it now.

683
00:48:38,017 --> 00:48:41,020
Yes, on the souffle. Give us
a half a minute on the rest.

684
00:48:41,062 --> 00:48:43,815
Very good, sir.

685
00:48:47,026 --> 00:48:50,780
- I'm leaning towards the spaetzle.
- Colonel Slade --

686
00:48:50,863 --> 00:48:53,741
Charlie, rolls on the table ?
Give 'em to me.

687
00:48:53,825 --> 00:48:55,827
You should
try these rolls.

688
00:48:55,910 --> 00:48:59,455
I used to dream about them
when I was at Fort Huachuca.

689
00:48:59,539 --> 00:49:02,500
- Colonel Slade --
- Bread's no good west of the Colorado.

690
00:49:02,584 --> 00:49:07,046
- Water's too alkaline.
- Colonel Slade, did you say --

691
00:49:07,088 --> 00:49:10,717
Did I hear you right ?

692
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:12,635
Y-You said you're gonna
kill yourself ?

693
00:49:12,719 --> 00:49:17,890
No, I said I was gonna
blow my brains out.

694
00:49:17,974 --> 00:49:21,519
Try one of these rolls, Charlie.
I buttered it for ya.

695
00:49:21,561 --> 00:49:23,897
I don't want a roll,
all right ?

696
00:49:23,938 --> 00:49:25,857
Okay. Have a radish !

697
00:49:25,899 --> 00:49:29,027
Hah !

698
00:49:29,110 --> 00:49:33,698
Hello ! Bring me a double
Jack Daniels on the rocks.

699
00:49:33,781 --> 00:49:35,742
Yes, sir.
Right away.

700
00:49:40,079 --> 00:49:42,665
Please, don't do that.

701
00:49:42,749 --> 00:49:45,043
Don't do that.

702
00:49:50,757 --> 00:49:55,178
Hmm.

703
00:49:55,261 --> 00:49:57,305
What a marvelous place !

704
00:50:00,934 --> 00:50:02,894
Okay.

705
00:50:05,897 --> 00:50:07,815
Yeah.

706
00:50:09,108 --> 00:50:11,194
Your billet is here.

707
00:50:11,277 --> 00:50:15,406
You'll find bedding
in the closet on the shelf.

708
00:50:15,448 --> 00:50:20,245
In the morning, the area will be
returned to sitting-room mode...

709
00:50:20,286 --> 00:50:23,581
no later than
0700 hours.

710
00:50:25,291 --> 00:50:28,253
What was that ?

711
00:50:30,630 --> 00:50:33,049
Nothing.

712
00:50:33,132 --> 00:50:38,263
Next time...
snap it out !

713
00:50:38,346 --> 00:50:43,810
Thumb to palm, index finger
through little digit, smartly aligned,

714
00:50:43,851 --> 00:50:46,437
sharp to the hairline,
down !

715
00:50:51,150 --> 00:50:53,486
Too many men,
far better than you,

716
00:50:53,528 --> 00:50:56,239
have executed
that courtesy.

717
00:50:56,322 --> 00:50:59,867
And if you're smart,
you won't try it again.

718
00:51:03,329 --> 00:51:08,376
This bat has got sharper radar
than the Nautilus.

719
00:51:08,459 --> 00:51:10,920
Don't fuck with me,
Charlie.

720
00:51:21,431 --> 00:51:23,933
See you get
a good night's sleep, son.

721
00:51:36,404 --> 00:51:39,032
?It's a lovely day today ?

722
00:51:39,115 --> 00:51:42,076
?So, whatever
you gotta do ?

723
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:45,079
?You got a lovely day
to do it in that's true ?

724
00:51:51,377 --> 00:51:53,379
Good morning, Charlie.

725
00:51:56,215 --> 00:51:59,844
- Good morning..
- This is Sofia, Charlie.

726
00:51:59,928 --> 00:52:02,430
She's a magician
with a needle.

727
00:52:02,513 --> 00:52:05,475
Sofia's workin' me up
a little "Glen Plaid" number,

728
00:52:05,558 --> 00:52:08,228
and I've asked her if she'd
put something together for you.

729
00:52:08,311 --> 00:52:11,898
- Uh, I don't need any clothes, Colonel.
- Standard issue...

730
00:52:11,981 --> 00:52:14,567
for an upscale
urban assignment.

731
00:52:14,651 --> 00:52:17,320
You don't like the clothes,
Charlie, on completion of duty,

732
00:52:17,362 --> 00:52:19,572
you can give 'em away.

733
00:52:19,656 --> 00:52:22,992
Juice, coffee, and other assorted
goodies on the trolley over there.

734
00:52:23,034 --> 00:52:25,286
Get yourself up,
get yourself together !

735
00:52:25,370 --> 00:52:28,831
?It's a great day
for singin' a song ?

736
00:52:28,915 --> 00:52:32,835
?And it's a great day
for movin' along ?

737
00:52:32,877 --> 00:52:35,463
?And it's a great day
from morning to night ?

738
00:52:35,546 --> 00:52:39,008
?And it's
a great day ?

739
00:52:39,092 --> 00:52:42,262
for everybody's plight.

740
00:52:46,724 --> 00:52:48,893
How are you feeling
today, Colonel ?

741
00:52:48,977 --> 00:52:52,230
Super !
Superior !

742
00:52:52,313 --> 00:52:55,108
Superfluous !

743
00:52:55,191 --> 00:52:57,318
Young Sofie here
is working Thanksgiving...

744
00:52:57,402 --> 00:52:59,612
because she's trying to
put herself through college.

745
00:52:59,696 --> 00:53:03,199
I told her, "My young friend
Charlie's headed for college."

746
00:53:03,241 --> 00:53:05,868
- Uh, excuse me.
- Where you goin' ?

747
00:53:05,952 --> 00:53:09,581
- I-l need to use the phone.
- What's wrong with the phones in here ?

748
00:53:09,664 --> 00:53:12,208
I don't want
to disturb you.

749
00:53:12,292 --> 00:53:14,335
You're not disturbing me.
Make your call.

750
00:53:14,419 --> 00:53:16,588
I'd kinda like
to be private.

751
00:53:16,671 --> 00:53:19,632
Stay outta my room !

752
00:53:19,716 --> 00:53:22,427
This is as private
as you're gonna get.

753
00:53:25,096 --> 00:53:29,809
?But if you've got somethin'
that must be done ?

754
00:53:29,893 --> 00:53:33,980
?And it can only
be done by one ?

755
00:53:35,064 --> 00:53:37,817
Sofia...

756
00:53:37,901 --> 00:53:41,404
what are the chances
of suitin' you up sometime ?

757
00:53:41,487 --> 00:53:44,449
- Sugarbush Lodge..
- George Willis, please.

758
00:53:47,452 --> 00:53:50,872
- Hello ! !
- George ! Hey, it's Charlie.

759
00:53:50,955 --> 00:53:54,083
Hey, Chas. Next year you gotta
come up with us.

760
00:53:54,167 --> 00:53:59,255
White powder on
a base of snow bunnies.

761
00:53:59,297 --> 00:54:01,966
Chas,
are you there ?

762
00:54:02,050 --> 00:54:04,260
Yeah, I'm here.
Um --

763
00:54:04,302 --> 00:54:07,430
- you told me to call you for the moves.
- All right.

764
00:54:07,513 --> 00:54:10,308
- For now, the move's
- status quo.

765
00:54:10,391 --> 00:54:12,310
Everything's
the way we left it.

766
00:54:12,393 --> 00:54:14,979
How did we leave it ?

767
00:54:15,063 --> 00:54:18,733
See no evil,
hear no evil.

768
00:54:18,816 --> 00:54:22,362
You know
what I mean, Chas ?

769
00:54:22,445 --> 00:54:25,323
Yeah. See no evil,
hear no evil.

770
00:54:27,575 --> 00:54:32,789
- Okay, then, walk like you talk !
- All right, good-bye.

771
00:54:32,872 --> 00:54:37,919
- George Willis, huh ?
- Yeah.

772
00:54:38,002 --> 00:54:39,921
George Willis.

773
00:54:40,004 --> 00:54:43,925
That makes his father probably
George Willis, Senior.

774
00:54:44,008 --> 00:54:45,927
Charlie, I ask ya,

775
00:54:46,010 --> 00:54:49,889
what do you think Big George
is gonna feel about Little George...

776
00:54:49,973 --> 00:54:53,017
seeing no evil,
hearing no evil ?

777
00:54:55,603 --> 00:54:57,730
Well, we're not gonna
tell our parents.

778
00:54:57,814 --> 00:55:00,692
We're just gonna keep it
between ourselves.

779
00:55:00,775 --> 00:55:04,946
Oh, George isn't gonna tell
his father about this thing !

780
00:55:05,029 --> 00:55:07,865
Damn decent of him.
Ooh ! Aw ! Hah !

781
00:55:07,949 --> 00:55:10,243
- Scusi.
- Prego.

782
00:55:10,326 --> 00:55:12,704
I love it
when you hurt me.

783
00:55:12,787 --> 00:55:15,248
Uh, tell me now,
Charlie.

784
00:55:15,331 --> 00:55:19,294
This, uh, George Willis, Junior,
what's his father do ?

785
00:55:19,377 --> 00:55:21,421
I don't really know.

786
00:55:21,504 --> 00:55:24,048
Well, I'm gonna tell ya.

787
00:55:24,132 --> 00:55:28,886
When George Willis, Sr., isn't busy as a
million-dollar man for Aetna Casualty --

788
00:55:28,970 --> 00:55:32,390
or is it New England Distributor
for the Chrysler Corporation ?

789
00:55:32,473 --> 00:55:36,477
He concerns himself with his young son,
George Willis, Junior.

790
00:55:36,561 --> 00:55:39,898
George isn't going
to say anything to his father.

791
00:55:39,939 --> 00:55:42,233
Oh, Charlie.

792
00:55:42,275 --> 00:55:44,485
Big George is gonna
wind up Little George,

793
00:55:44,569 --> 00:55:47,697
and Little George is gonna sing
like a canary.

794
00:55:47,739 --> 00:55:50,283
And if you're hip, kid,
you're gonna hop to, too.

795
00:55:50,366 --> 00:55:52,452
You've got this
all figured out, don't you ?

796
00:55:52,535 --> 00:55:56,915
It don't take no Young America merit
scholarship to figure this one out.

797
00:55:56,998 --> 00:56:00,877
Charlie, you had a little life,
so you decided to go to Baird...

798
00:56:00,919 --> 00:56:04,005
to put yourself in the market
for a big one.

799
00:56:04,088 --> 00:56:06,049
Now, in order to stay
in the running,

800
00:56:06,090 --> 00:56:08,968
you're gonna have to tell these people
what they want to know.

801
00:56:09,052 --> 00:56:11,220
You think so ?

802
00:56:11,304 --> 00:56:13,264
- Are we finished, Sofia ?
- Yes.

803
00:56:13,306 --> 00:56:16,184
Grazie. Grazie.

804
00:56:17,977 --> 00:56:20,563
Charlie,

805
00:56:20,605 --> 00:56:23,483
if you don't sing now,

806
00:56:23,566 --> 00:56:26,861
you're gonna end up,
not only shelving biscuits...

807
00:56:26,945 --> 00:56:29,906
in some convenience store
in the Oregon burbs,

808
00:56:29,989 --> 00:56:34,202
probably the last word you'll ever hear
yourself say just before you croak...

809
00:56:34,285 --> 00:56:38,248
gonna be, "Have a nice day
and come back soon."

810
00:56:38,331 --> 00:56:40,500
Sofia !

811
00:56:40,583 --> 00:56:44,545
Measure up Charlie, pronto.
We got a date for Thanksgiving.

812
00:56:44,629 --> 00:56:46,631
We got a date ?

813
00:56:46,714 --> 00:56:48,883
My brother's place.

814
00:56:48,967 --> 00:56:51,719
W.R. Slade,
White Plains, New York.

815
00:56:51,803 --> 00:56:55,265
Colonel, I can't go with you
to your brother's place.

816
00:56:55,306 --> 00:56:58,101
I mean, I should be
getting back to school.

817
00:57:00,478 --> 00:57:04,941
Uh, well you gotta have
Thanksgiving somewhere.

818
00:57:05,024 --> 00:57:08,820
I mean, eats and treats.
I could use the company.

819
00:57:12,448 --> 00:57:15,368
All right.
D-Does he know I'm comin' ?

820
00:57:15,451 --> 00:57:18,371
He doesn't know I'm comin'. But wait
till you see the look on his face...

821
00:57:18,454 --> 00:57:20,373
when I walk through
the door.

822
00:57:20,456 --> 00:57:23,126
Oh, he loves me !

823
00:57:24,460 --> 00:57:28,339
Oh, uh, Charlie,
about your little problem,

824
00:57:28,423 --> 00:57:30,925
there are two kinds of people
in this world:

825
00:57:31,009 --> 00:57:33,428
those who stand up
and face the music,

826
00:57:33,511 --> 00:57:35,430
and those who
run for cover.

827
00:57:35,513 --> 00:57:39,100
Cover's better.
Okay, Sofia, suit 'im up !

828
00:57:39,183 --> 00:57:42,812
Make him pretty !

829
00:57:57,160 --> 00:58:00,121
Careful.

830
00:58:00,163 --> 00:58:03,082
- Should I ring it ?
- Yeah.

831
00:58:09,631 --> 00:58:11,633
Yes ?

832
00:58:11,716 --> 00:58:14,177
Yes !
Who is this ?

833
00:58:14,260 --> 00:58:18,640
- It's Randy.
- Randy ? You new ?

834
00:58:18,681 --> 00:58:20,850
I'm your nephew.

835
00:58:20,934 --> 00:58:23,603
Hah !
Here I am !

836
00:58:23,686 --> 00:58:26,856
Your sister's been
hoarding me long enough.

837
00:58:26,940 --> 00:58:29,859
- Thought it's time to spread
the riches around.
- Uncle Frank !

838
00:58:29,943 --> 00:58:31,903
- Gloria !
- Gail.

839
00:58:31,986 --> 00:58:33,905
Of course.

840
00:58:33,988 --> 00:58:37,450
Say hello to the potluck
party from New York City.

841
00:58:37,533 --> 00:58:40,578
Good old Uncle Frank and this here
with him is Charlie Simms,

842
00:58:40,662 --> 00:58:42,956
star halfback of the
Baird football team.

843
00:58:42,997 --> 00:58:47,252
They not only beat Exeter and Groton,
but Aquinas High School too.

844
00:58:47,335 --> 00:58:49,837
Where's your
miserable father ?

845
00:58:49,921 --> 00:58:52,465
Wait ! No, no.
Let's surprise him.

846
00:58:52,507 --> 00:58:55,593
Give that fat heart
of his an attack. Willie !

847
00:58:57,887 --> 00:59:00,765
Oh, Willie !

848
00:59:11,109 --> 00:59:13,111
Hello, Frank.

849
00:59:13,194 --> 00:59:16,573
- How you doin' ?
- Okay.

850
00:59:16,656 --> 00:59:21,452
Here's my hand.
Charlie, meet W.R. Slade.

851
00:59:21,536 --> 00:59:23,580
Nice to meet you, sir.

852
00:59:23,663 --> 00:59:26,541
The original bulging
briefcase man.

853
00:59:26,624 --> 00:59:31,045
Gretchen, I smell those prunes !
We talkin' Turkey Marbella ?

854
00:59:31,087 --> 00:59:33,840
- Yes, we are.
- Whoo !

855
00:59:33,923 --> 00:59:36,593
Let's have a whiff.
Come on.

856
00:59:36,676 --> 00:59:38,636
You know, I always had a sneaker
for you. Come here.

857
00:59:38,720 --> 00:59:40,847
Mmm.

858
00:59:40,930 --> 00:59:42,890
Hah !

859
00:59:42,932 --> 00:59:47,186
- Where are you, Garry ?
I heard you cough.
- Who are you again ?

860
00:59:47,228 --> 00:59:51,858
I'm just here at the Waldorf-Astoria
with -- Is it your brother ?

861
00:59:51,941 --> 00:59:54,402
W.R.'s final issue.
How ya doin' ?

862
00:59:54,444 --> 00:59:59,532
- Yes. Who the hell are you ?
- I'm kinda takin' care
of him for the weekend.

863
00:59:59,616 --> 01:00:00,742
Charlie !

864
01:00:00,825 --> 01:00:03,036
Jesus !

865
01:00:03,077 --> 01:00:07,624
Sorry. Where's the booze ?
Flowin' like mud here.

866
01:00:07,707 --> 01:00:11,961
To tell the truth, the colonel's
not well, I don't think.

867
01:00:12,045 --> 01:00:15,131
- Not well ?
- I think he's a little lonely.

868
01:00:15,214 --> 01:00:18,092
Why didn't you take him
to your family's for dinner ?

869
01:00:18,176 --> 01:00:20,803
I heard that !

870
01:00:20,887 --> 01:00:23,264
I heard that.

871
01:00:23,348 --> 01:00:25,975
Pay no attention to him.
That's his big-brother talk.

872
01:00:26,059 --> 01:00:28,728
He's been watching out for me
since day one.

873
01:00:28,770 --> 01:00:33,316
Bailed me out of more trouble...
than he'd like to remember.

874
01:00:33,399 --> 01:00:35,902
- Hmm ?
- Let me take your coat.

875
01:00:35,985 --> 01:00:40,448
I meant to pick up some vino
on my way, but I blew it.

876
01:00:40,531 --> 01:00:42,992
I'll send you the Rothschild
again for Christmas,

877
01:00:43,076 --> 01:00:46,996
- only let's see how Thanksgiving goes.
- I'll set two more places.

878
01:00:47,080 --> 01:00:50,416
- Here's your drink, Frank.
- Thank you, Randy.

879
01:00:50,458 --> 01:00:53,086
Still with
Snow Queen sugar ?

880
01:00:53,127 --> 01:00:56,965
Snow Flake. Why do you
always get that wrong ?

881
01:00:57,048 --> 01:01:00,343
Because it's not important for me to
get it right. What are you doing there ?

882
01:01:00,426 --> 01:01:03,680
I'm Vice President
for Marketing.

883
01:01:03,763 --> 01:01:07,725
Whoo-ah ! Congratulations !
Sugar is shit, though.

884
01:01:07,809 --> 01:01:11,229
I told General Abrams to install
honey in the commissaries.

885
01:01:11,312 --> 01:01:14,607
If the K-50s didn't blow your brains
out, sugar, sure as shit, was gonna.

886
01:01:16,192 --> 01:01:18,528
- Why don't we all sit down ?
- Ooh !

887
01:01:18,611 --> 01:01:22,532
Mitsouki. Rhymes with nookie.
Be careful.

888
01:01:22,615 --> 01:01:26,578
- When the wife gets restless,
the wife gets racy.
- Let's go and eat.

889
01:01:26,661 --> 01:01:31,583
By all means.
Thank you, Charlie.

890
01:01:31,666 --> 01:01:35,795
Where you wanna sit, Frank, or you gonna
arrange yourself at the head again ?

891
01:01:35,878 --> 01:01:40,133
Any old card table
will do. This is fine.

892
01:01:40,216 --> 01:01:43,469
Where was I ? Oh !

893
01:01:43,511 --> 01:01:46,931
I wake up. It's four in the morning.
I don't know who I'm with,

894
01:01:47,015 --> 01:01:49,225
why I'm there
and where I am.

895
01:01:49,309 --> 01:01:52,270
What am I gonna do ?
I got this Asian flower,

896
01:01:52,353 --> 01:01:56,816
all giggly and dewy-like;

897
01:01:56,900 --> 01:02:00,778
and this hard-boiled
navy nurse outta Omaha, on the other.

898
01:02:00,862 --> 01:02:05,158
We're three across the bed,
not a stitch of clothes on.

899
01:02:05,199 --> 01:02:07,619
It comes to me.

900
01:02:07,702 --> 01:02:12,290
Let east meet west.
We'll build a golden bridge.

901
01:02:12,373 --> 01:02:14,083
Hah-hah !

902
01:02:14,167 --> 01:02:16,836
I felt like I'd just joined
the corps of engineers !

903
01:02:21,716 --> 01:02:24,385
We all still here ?

904
01:02:24,469 --> 01:02:27,889
It's a beautiful story.

905
01:02:30,099 --> 01:02:34,687
- Do you always enjoy
shocking people, Uncle Frank ?
- Honey.

906
01:02:34,771 --> 01:02:37,065
I didn't know you were
so easily shocked.

907
01:02:37,148 --> 01:02:39,692
I admire your sensibilities.
I'm touched.

908
01:02:39,776 --> 01:02:42,820
Dad, remember the time
you persuaded Frank...

909
01:02:42,904 --> 01:02:46,241
- to go to the kennel ?
- What about it ?

910
01:02:46,324 --> 01:02:49,619
- He almost put the seeing eye
dog business outta business.
- Cool it, Randy.

911
01:02:49,702 --> 01:02:53,873
- It's over and done with.
- Indeed it is, Garry.

912
01:02:53,957 --> 01:02:56,292
Indeed it is.
So is dinner.

913
01:02:56,376 --> 01:02:59,462
Charlie, what time do you have ?
I think we better be gettin' back.

914
01:02:59,545 --> 01:03:04,467
- You ever given any thought
to a braille watch, Frank ?
- Randy.

915
01:03:04,550 --> 01:03:08,513
- Stevie Wonder wears one,
or do you rank on him too ?
- Honey, please.

916
01:03:08,596 --> 01:03:10,890
It's all right, Gloria.
I enjoy Randy's observations.

917
01:03:10,932 --> 01:03:14,894
My wife's name is Gail, Frank.
Can you hear that ? Gail.

918
01:03:14,978 --> 01:03:17,438
Excuse me.
Gail.

919
01:03:17,522 --> 01:03:21,276
Gail strikes me as
a very beautiful woman,

920
01:03:21,359 --> 01:03:23,945
but there's a
little tension in her voice.

921
01:03:24,028 --> 01:03:26,823
It could be one
of two things:

922
01:03:26,906 --> 01:03:29,284
either Gail is nervous
or unsatisfied.

923
01:03:29,993 --> 01:03:33,830
What's your point,
Uncle Frank ?

924
01:03:33,830 --> 01:03:36,165
You oughta go down
on her.

925
01:03:36,207 --> 01:03:38,334
Cut it out, Frank,
will ya ?

926
01:03:38,418 --> 01:03:41,796
You're so wrapped up in sugar, you've
forgotten the taste of real honey !

927
01:03:41,838 --> 01:03:43,715
Frank,
for God's sake !

928
01:03:43,798 --> 01:03:46,426
Hear that voice ?
There's fire under that dress.

929
01:03:46,509 --> 01:03:48,595
- Will you cut it out ?
- Just get the fuck outta here.

930
01:03:48,678 --> 01:03:51,097
- Whoo-ah !
- Get in your limousine.

931
01:03:51,180 --> 01:03:54,350
Go down to the bowery, get with the
other fucking drunks where you belong !

932
01:03:54,434 --> 01:03:56,603
- Wait a minute.
- What ?

933
01:03:56,686 --> 01:03:59,647
- Could you take it easy ?
- What for ?

934
01:03:59,689 --> 01:04:02,191
You want me to lay off him,
Chuckie, 'cause he's blind ?

935
01:04:02,275 --> 01:04:05,236
- No, but I mean --
- My friend's name is Charles.

936
01:04:05,320 --> 01:04:07,822
He doesn't like
to be called Chuckie.

937
01:04:07,864 --> 01:04:11,534
- This is supposed to be a family
get-together. This is --
- A warning.

938
01:04:11,618 --> 01:04:15,788
Jesus Christ. Another sucker who thinks
this shitheel's a war hero.

939
01:04:15,872 --> 01:04:18,750
Whoo-ah.

940
01:04:20,209 --> 01:04:23,379
Well, once... maybe.

941
01:04:23,463 --> 01:04:27,383
I suppose he told you about his days
on Lyndon Johnson's staff ?

942
01:04:27,467 --> 01:04:30,053
I was gonna go.
Now I'm not leaving.

943
01:04:30,136 --> 01:04:33,848
- Frank was earmarked for general.
- Earmarked, good word.

944
01:04:33,932 --> 01:04:38,102
- But Frank likes to spit
in everybody's eye !
- Randy, that's enough.

945
01:04:38,186 --> 01:04:42,565
So -- What do they call it when they
give you the shaft in the military ?

946
01:04:42,649 --> 01:04:47,111
- Passed over !
- Frank was passed over for promotion...

947
01:04:47,195 --> 01:04:50,615
Couple times.

948
01:04:52,700 --> 01:04:55,787
- You want to know what happened then ?
- Will you shut your mouth ?

949
01:04:55,870 --> 01:05:00,708
- He blew himself up.
- Stop it, Randy.

950
01:05:00,750 --> 01:05:04,170
Our colonel, here, had a grenade
juggling act at Fort Bragg or wherever.

951
01:05:04,254 --> 01:05:07,548
- Fort Benning.
- He was teaching hand-to-hand combat --

952
01:05:07,632 --> 01:05:11,261
Randy, look at me when
you're talking to me, son.

953
01:05:11,344 --> 01:05:15,848
I'm lookin', Frank.
His partner in the act was some captain.

954
01:05:15,932 --> 01:05:18,560
- Major Vincent Squires.
- Yeah, whoever he was.

955
01:05:18,643 --> 01:05:22,146
Before going on, they'd have themselves
a lo-cal breakfast:

956
01:05:22,230 --> 01:05:24,148
a Screwdriver for Frank,
Bloody Mary for his partner.

957
01:05:24,232 --> 01:05:26,067
No, Vincent drank
Sea Breezes.

958
01:05:26,150 --> 01:05:29,445
Judge Advocate at Benning said Col.
Slade had four to his partner's one.

959
01:05:29,445 --> 01:05:31,656
Judge Advocate at Benning said Col.
Slade had four to his partner's one.

960
01:05:31,739 --> 01:05:34,242
He's flying in class.
He gets all excited.

961
01:05:34,284 --> 01:05:36,953
He starts pulling
the pins out.

962
01:05:38,955 --> 01:05:41,583
One grenade
got away from him.

963
01:05:41,624 --> 01:05:44,627
Boom.

964
01:05:46,296 --> 01:05:48,214
The one that got away.

965
01:05:48,298 --> 01:05:52,260
Oh, the pin was in...
Frank claims.

966
01:05:52,302 --> 01:05:54,220
In or out, what
difference does it make ?

967
01:05:54,304 --> 01:05:56,514
What kind of fucking lunatic
juggles grenades ?

968
01:05:56,598 --> 01:05:59,100
Vinnie came out okay.

969
01:05:59,142 --> 01:06:01,728
And all Frank lost
was his eyesight.

970
01:06:04,981 --> 01:06:08,443
- Wanna know the truth ?
- You got a handle on that,
do you, Randy ?

971
01:06:08,526 --> 01:06:11,613
- He was an asshole before.
- Whoo-ah !

972
01:06:11,654 --> 01:06:15,491
Now all he is
is a blind asshole.

973
01:06:15,575 --> 01:06:17,619
Whoo-ah.

974
01:06:24,125 --> 01:06:27,128
Hey, God's a funny guy.

975
01:06:27,211 --> 01:06:32,300
God doth have
a sense of humor.

976
01:06:32,342 --> 01:06:37,347
Maybe God thinks some
people don't deserve to see.

977
01:06:37,430 --> 01:06:40,934
Whoo-ah. Hah !

978
01:06:43,353 --> 01:06:45,230
You get the point...
Chuckie ?

979
01:06:49,609 --> 01:06:51,986
- Aah !
- His name is Charles.

980
01:06:53,154 --> 01:06:55,323
You can say that,
can't you ? Charles.

981
01:06:55,365 --> 01:06:59,577
Know what this is, Randy ? It's a choke
hold I'm teaching those lieutenants.

982
01:06:59,661 --> 01:07:03,998
- Little pressure, I bust your windpipe.
- I don't care what he said.

983
01:07:04,040 --> 01:07:07,377
- Charles.
- Just let go, please !

984
01:07:27,397 --> 01:07:30,149
Gretchen ?

985
01:07:30,233 --> 01:07:33,444
You outdid yourself.

986
01:07:33,528 --> 01:07:36,406
If you twist my arm
hard enough,

987
01:07:36,489 --> 01:07:39,450
we're talking
Turkey Marbella next year.

988
01:07:39,534 --> 01:07:42,662
Who knows ?

989
01:07:45,790 --> 01:07:47,834
Frank ?

990
01:07:47,917 --> 01:07:51,546
Good-bye, Willie.

991
01:07:56,217 --> 01:08:00,221
I'm no fucking good...

992
01:08:00,305 --> 01:08:03,057
and I never have been.

993
01:08:08,271 --> 01:08:11,608
Come on, Charlie,
get the coats.

994
01:08:17,238 --> 01:08:21,117
Come on.
Watch your step.

995
01:08:21,993 --> 01:08:24,996
Hold it.

996
01:08:37,425 --> 01:08:41,554
Nueva York, compadre.
Vamos !

997
01:09:25,682 --> 01:09:27,767
You got a watch ?

998
01:09:30,853 --> 01:09:33,106
Ah, it's 7:20.

999
01:09:33,189 --> 01:09:37,151
I didn't ask you the time.
I asked if you had a watch.

1000
01:09:37,193 --> 01:09:39,320
Yeah, in the other room.

1001
01:09:39,362 --> 01:09:41,990
Get it.

1002
01:09:44,367 --> 01:09:47,120
Colonel, there's a clock
right next to your bed.

1003
01:09:48,871 --> 01:09:51,332
Does it have
a second hand ?

1004
01:09:56,504 --> 01:09:58,506
Yeah.

1005
01:09:58,548 --> 01:10:00,883
Time me !

1006
01:10:27,368 --> 01:10:29,370
How long ?

1007
01:10:30,914 --> 01:10:34,542
Um... about
30 seconds.

1008
01:10:34,584 --> 01:10:38,755
- I'm rusty.
- Where did you get a gun, Colonel ?

1009
01:10:38,838 --> 01:10:41,716
Piece or weapon, Charlie,
never a gun.

1010
01:10:44,594 --> 01:10:46,971
Where did you get
the piece ?

1011
01:10:47,055 --> 01:10:51,517
I'm an officer in the
United States Army. This is my sidearm.

1012
01:10:51,601 --> 01:10:55,939
- But you're not an officer anymore.
- So I'm retired, so what ?

1013
01:10:55,980 --> 01:10:59,317
An officer never
relinquishes his 45.

1014
01:10:59,400 --> 01:11:03,321
Yeah, but you better relinquish it to me
or I'm gonna call Mrs. Rossi.

1015
01:11:03,404 --> 01:11:05,073
Good idea.

1016
01:11:05,156 --> 01:11:07,742
Then I'm going back
to school.

1017
01:11:07,784 --> 01:11:10,453
Even better.
Blue skies, green lights.

1018
01:11:10,536 --> 01:11:14,123
I hope you have a wonderful trip.
That felt like 25.

1019
01:11:14,207 --> 01:11:16,960
You oughta be able to do a 45 in 25.
Did you time me ?

1020
01:11:17,043 --> 01:11:20,213
No, I did not
and I'm calling Albany.

1021
01:11:27,428 --> 01:11:30,431
That was stupid.

1022
01:11:30,515 --> 01:11:34,185
Was it ?

1023
01:11:34,269 --> 01:11:37,021
You're stuck with me,
Charlie.

1024
01:11:37,105 --> 01:11:39,315
No, I'm not.

1025
01:11:39,440 --> 01:11:41,734
- I'm outta here !
- Where you goin' ? New Hampshire ?

1026
01:11:41,776 --> 01:11:45,655
You got no money.
How you gonna do that ?

1027
01:11:45,738 --> 01:11:48,449
Mmm.

1028
01:11:48,491 --> 01:11:52,495
Karen's number
tastes like Albany. Hah !

1029
01:11:52,579 --> 01:11:54,789
Fine.

1030
01:11:54,872 --> 01:11:58,126
- I'm leaving.
- Charlie ? Charlie !

1031
01:12:10,805 --> 01:12:15,268
All I want from you...
is another day.

1032
01:12:15,351 --> 01:12:17,770
For what ?

1033
01:12:19,898 --> 01:12:23,985
One last tour
of the battlefield.

1034
01:12:26,654 --> 01:12:30,116
I can get around a city
like New York,

1035
01:12:30,158 --> 01:12:32,118
but l...

1036
01:12:32,160 --> 01:12:36,039
sometimes need a point
in the right direction.

1037
01:12:38,207 --> 01:12:40,168
What do you say,
Charlie ?

1038
01:12:40,251 --> 01:12:43,421
What's one day...
between friends ?

1039
01:12:47,216 --> 01:12:50,178
All right. Well, say
I stay for another day.

1040
01:12:50,261 --> 01:12:52,513
Will you give me
your weapon ?

1041
01:12:52,555 --> 01:12:56,643
Oh, Charlie ! I'm a lieutenant colonel,
United States Army.

1042
01:12:56,726 --> 01:12:59,187
I'm not giving my
fucking gun to anyone.

1043
01:12:59,229 --> 01:13:03,816
- Now, what are you drinkin' ?
- Colonel, this -- this is unacceptable.

1044
01:13:03,900 --> 01:13:08,738
Unacceptable ? What are you givin' me
that prep school crap for ?

1045
01:13:08,821 --> 01:13:12,325
What have they done,
taken the Oregon out of the boy ?

1046
01:13:12,367 --> 01:13:14,410
Put in Harvard
Business School ?

1047
01:13:14,494 --> 01:13:17,080
Then give me
your bullets.

1048
01:13:23,670 --> 01:13:28,258
You do see the sense of it,
Charlie, don't you ?

1049
01:13:29,842 --> 01:13:33,096
I can't chew
the leather anymore.

1050
01:13:33,179 --> 01:13:35,807
So, why
should I share...

1051
01:13:35,890 --> 01:13:40,144
the tribe's provisions ?

1052
01:13:40,228 --> 01:13:42,689
I mean,
there's no one...

1053
01:13:42,730 --> 01:13:47,193
wants to tear a herring
with me anymore.

1054
01:13:47,235 --> 01:13:49,404
The bullets, Colonel.

1055
01:13:49,487 --> 01:13:51,573
"The bullets, Colonel."

1056
01:13:51,656 --> 01:13:54,367
You sound like a guy in
"Lives of a Bengal Lancer."

1057
01:14:14,095 --> 01:14:16,264
What do you
give a shit for ?

1058
01:14:16,347 --> 01:14:18,766
About what ?

1059
01:14:18,850 --> 01:14:21,019
About what ?

1060
01:14:21,102 --> 01:14:25,106
About whether I blow
my brains out or not.

1061
01:14:28,943 --> 01:14:33,072
- Because I have a conscience, you know.
- You have a conscience.

1062
01:14:33,114 --> 01:14:35,909
I forgot.

1063
01:14:37,452 --> 01:14:40,163
The Charlie Conscience.

1064
01:14:41,456 --> 01:14:45,501
Do we tell ?
Do we not tell ?

1065
01:14:45,585 --> 01:14:49,255
Do we follow the
rich boy's code or not ?

1066
01:14:49,297 --> 01:14:52,383
Do we let this
blind asshole...

1067
01:14:52,467 --> 01:14:55,136
die... or not ?

1068
01:14:55,178 --> 01:14:56,721
Yeah.

1069
01:14:56,804 --> 01:14:58,932
Conscience, Charlie.

1070
01:14:58,973 --> 01:15:01,434
When were you born, son ?

1071
01:15:01,476 --> 01:15:05,438
Around the time
of the Round Table ? Hah.

1072
01:15:05,521 --> 01:15:07,649
Haven't you heard ?

1073
01:15:07,732 --> 01:15:10,944
Conscience is dead.

1074
01:15:10,985 --> 01:15:13,696
No, I haven't heard.

1075
01:15:13,780 --> 01:15:18,826
Well, then, take the
fucking wax outta your ears !

1076
01:15:18,910 --> 01:15:20,828
Grow up !

1077
01:15:32,382 --> 01:15:35,510
It's fuck your buddy.

1078
01:15:35,593 --> 01:15:38,596
Cheat on your wife.

1079
01:15:40,640 --> 01:15:44,310
Call your mother
on Mother's Day.

1080
01:15:45,353 --> 01:15:50,316
Charlie,
it's all shit.

1081
01:16:00,118 --> 01:16:02,370
Where you goin' ?

1082
01:16:02,412 --> 01:16:05,999
I got piss call.

1083
01:16:06,082 --> 01:16:09,919
I know I said I need ya
for just one day,

1084
01:16:10,003 --> 01:16:12,463
but even I can't hold it
that long.

1085
01:16:14,716 --> 01:16:17,135
Oh, and, Charlie,

1086
01:16:17,218 --> 01:16:19,846
you forgot the one
in the chamber.

1087
01:16:25,518 --> 01:16:27,437
Hah !

1088
01:16:27,520 --> 01:16:29,898
There you go,
sir.

1089
01:16:29,981 --> 01:16:31,816
Thank you.

1090
01:16:35,069 --> 01:16:38,239
Twenty-six years
in the service,

1091
01:16:38,323 --> 01:16:40,575
never let an aide
shine my shoes.

1092
01:16:40,658 --> 01:16:44,203
Where you gonna be
in 26 years, Charlie ?

1093
01:16:44,287 --> 01:16:48,207
Playing golf with your friends
from the Baird School, I bet.

1094
01:16:50,460 --> 01:16:53,421
I don't even like
those guys.

1095
01:16:53,463 --> 01:16:56,716
Course you don't.
They're all assholes.

1096
01:16:56,758 --> 01:16:59,802
Be a pleasure to squeal
on 'em, wouldn't it ?

1097
01:16:59,886 --> 01:17:04,307
- Yeah, well, I'm not a squealer.
- "I'm not a squealer."

1098
01:17:04,390 --> 01:17:06,476
What is this,
the Dreyfus case ?

1099
01:17:10,939 --> 01:17:13,107
Ohh ! Ooh, Mama !

1100
01:17:13,191 --> 01:17:15,443
There you go.

1101
01:17:15,526 --> 01:17:18,446
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1102
01:17:18,529 --> 01:17:20,490
Watch your step.

1103
01:17:23,409 --> 01:17:26,788
I'm gettin' that
heavy feelin' again, Charlie.

1104
01:17:29,499 --> 01:17:33,503
There's more to this,
isn't there ?

1105
01:17:33,586 --> 01:17:35,672
Isn't there ?

1106
01:17:38,049 --> 01:17:41,886
- I was offered a bribe.
- Oh, now we're cookin'.

1107
01:17:43,471 --> 01:17:46,099
Mr. Trask,
the headmaster,

1108
01:17:47,141 --> 01:17:49,978
he promised to
get me into Harvard.

1109
01:17:50,019 --> 01:17:53,314
- If you squeal.
- Yeah.

1110
01:17:53,398 --> 01:17:55,692
What a dilemma.

1111
01:17:55,775 --> 01:18:01,155
Should Charlie Simms accept a
free ride into Harvard or not ?

1112
01:18:01,239 --> 01:18:05,326
What do you think your friend George
would do if he were in your shoes ?

1113
01:18:05,410 --> 01:18:07,495
- He is, practically.
- How ?

1114
01:18:07,579 --> 01:18:12,333
I mean, it's just that Mr. Trask
hasn't promised to get him into Harvard.

1115
01:18:12,417 --> 01:18:16,671
Mr. Trask doesn't have to. George's
father's gonna take care of that.

1116
01:18:18,756 --> 01:18:21,551
Do the deal, Charlie.
Take it !

1117
01:18:21,634 --> 01:18:24,095
Go to Harvard.

1118
01:18:24,178 --> 01:18:27,015
- I can't do that.
- Why not ?

1119
01:18:28,933 --> 01:18:32,395
It's just some things
you just can't do.

1120
01:18:32,478 --> 01:18:34,856
Explain 'em to me.

1121
01:18:35,899 --> 01:18:40,653
- Louder, please.
- I, l, I can't --

1122
01:18:40,695 --> 01:18:43,907
You're gonna have a tough time
in this world, Charlie.

1123
01:18:45,241 --> 01:18:49,704
To ease the blow,
let me buy you a drink. Come on.

1124
01:18:49,996 --> 01:18:52,498
Double Jack Daniels
on the rocks.

1125
01:18:52,582 --> 01:18:56,878
And bring my young friend here
a Shirley Temple.

1126
01:18:56,920 --> 01:18:58,963
Hold on.
Do you have beer ?

1127
01:18:59,047 --> 01:19:01,591
Certainly.
May I see some I.D. ?

1128
01:19:01,674 --> 01:19:04,886
Are you interested in walkin'
the rest of your life, chappy ?

1129
01:19:04,928 --> 01:19:06,220
Sir, but --

1130
01:19:06,304 --> 01:19:09,807
I'm a regular here.
My boy's going on 23.

1131
01:19:09,891 --> 01:19:12,685
Why don't you call up front,
the office ?

1132
01:19:12,727 --> 01:19:16,189
Mr. Gilbert,
he's a friend of mine.

1133
01:19:16,272 --> 01:19:19,400
Any particular beer ?

1134
01:19:19,484 --> 01:19:22,779
Schlitz.
No Schlitz ?

1135
01:19:22,862 --> 01:19:25,281
Blatz.
No Blatz ?

1136
01:19:25,365 --> 01:19:27,742
Improvise.

1137
01:19:27,784 --> 01:19:31,037
- I'll do my best, sir.
- Thank you, sir.

1138
01:19:32,747 --> 01:19:36,542
You're human, Charlie.
Beer ?

1139
01:19:38,962 --> 01:19:41,130
Who are we
drinking with ?

1140
01:19:41,214 --> 01:19:45,718
I'm getting a nice soap-and-water
feeling from down there.

1141
01:19:52,392 --> 01:19:56,062
- Ah... female.
- Female ?

1142
01:19:56,145 --> 01:20:00,567
You're callin' her female, must mean you
like her or you wouldn't be so casual.

1143
01:20:03,236 --> 01:20:06,864
- Is she alone ?
- Yeah, she's alone.

1144
01:20:09,158 --> 01:20:12,412
Things are heatin' up.
Chestnut hair ?

1145
01:20:12,495 --> 01:20:15,832
Brown...
Light brown.

1146
01:20:15,915 --> 01:20:19,127
Twenty-two ?

1147
01:20:21,170 --> 01:20:23,506
Wh-- What am l,
a guy at a carnival ?

1148
01:20:23,590 --> 01:20:27,552
The day we stop lookin',
Charlie, is the day we die.

1149
01:20:27,635 --> 01:20:29,887
Move.

1150
01:20:29,971 --> 01:20:32,181
- Where ?
- You know where, son.

1151
01:20:32,265 --> 01:20:34,559
Don't be coy, Charlie.

1152
01:20:35,852 --> 01:20:38,771
This woman is made for you.
I can feel it.

1153
01:20:38,855 --> 01:20:41,107
Goddamn beautiful,
isn't she ?

1154
01:20:41,190 --> 01:20:45,820
- She's not bad.
- Whoo-bingo ! The boy's alive.

1155
01:20:45,904 --> 01:20:49,532
Come on, son,
perambulate.

1156
01:20:49,616 --> 01:20:53,286
Perambulate.

1157
01:21:00,793 --> 01:21:04,714
Excuse me, senorita,
do you mind if we join you ?

1158
01:21:06,090 --> 01:21:08,176
I'm feelin'
you're being neglected.

1159
01:21:08,259 --> 01:21:11,846
Well, I'm
expecting somebody.

1160
01:21:11,888 --> 01:21:15,141
Instantly ?

1161
01:21:15,225 --> 01:21:19,437
- No, but any minute now.
- Any minute ?

1162
01:21:19,520 --> 01:21:22,190
Some people live a lifetime
in a minute.

1163
01:21:24,067 --> 01:21:28,363
- What are you doin' right now ?
- I'm waiting for him.

1164
01:21:28,446 --> 01:21:31,532
Would you mind
if we waited with you,

1165
01:21:31,574 --> 01:21:35,745
you know, just to keep the
womanizers from bothering you ?

1166
01:21:38,831 --> 01:21:40,792
No, I don't mind.

1167
01:21:40,875 --> 01:21:43,544
Thank you.

1168
01:21:45,880 --> 01:21:47,840
Charlie.

1169
01:21:51,135 --> 01:21:54,514
You know, I detect...
a fragrance in the air.

1170
01:21:54,597 --> 01:21:56,975
Don't tell me
what it is.

1171
01:21:57,058 --> 01:21:59,269
Ogilvie Sisters soap.

1172
01:21:59,352 --> 01:22:02,564
Ah, that's amazing.

1173
01:22:02,647 --> 01:22:04,899
I'm in the amazing
business !

1174
01:22:04,941 --> 01:22:06,943
It is
Ogilvie Sisters soap.

1175
01:22:07,026 --> 01:22:10,321
My grandmother gave me
three bars for Christmas.

1176
01:22:10,405 --> 01:22:12,615
I'm crazy about
your grandmother.

1177
01:22:12,699 --> 01:22:15,493
I think she'd have liked
Charlie too.

1178
01:22:15,577 --> 01:22:17,870
- Don't pay any attention to him.
- What's your name ?

1179
01:22:17,954 --> 01:22:19,455
Donna.

1180
01:22:19,539 --> 01:22:24,252
- Donna ? I'm Frank. This here is --
- This is Charlie.

1181
01:22:24,335 --> 01:22:26,462
Yes. She likes you.

1182
01:22:26,546 --> 01:22:29,757
Charlie's having a difficult weekend.
He's going through a crisis.

1183
01:22:29,841 --> 01:22:32,594
How does he look
like he's holding up ?

1184
01:22:32,677 --> 01:22:35,638
He looks fine to me.

1185
01:22:35,680 --> 01:22:38,141
Oh ! She does
like you, Charlie.

1186
01:22:42,812 --> 01:22:45,064
So, Donna,

1187
01:22:45,148 --> 01:22:46,858
ah...

1188
01:22:46,941 --> 01:22:48,943
do you tango ?

1189
01:22:49,027 --> 01:22:52,614
No. I wanted
to learn once, but --

1190
01:22:52,697 --> 01:22:55,074
But ?

1191
01:22:55,158 --> 01:22:57,744
But Michael
didn't want to.

1192
01:22:57,827 --> 01:23:01,205
Michael, the one
you're waiting for.

1193
01:23:01,289 --> 01:23:05,001
Michael thinks
the tango's hysterical.

1194
01:23:05,084 --> 01:23:08,338
Well, I think
Michael's hysterical.

1195
01:23:08,421 --> 01:23:11,633
Don't pay any attention to him.
Did I already say that ?

1196
01:23:13,551 --> 01:23:16,054
What a beautiful laugh.

1197
01:23:17,555 --> 01:23:19,557
Thank you, Frank.

1198
01:23:24,312 --> 01:23:27,440
Would you like to learn
to tango, Donna ?

1199
01:23:30,526 --> 01:23:32,528
Right now ?

1200
01:23:32,570 --> 01:23:37,242
I'm offering you my services...
free of charge.

1201
01:23:37,325 --> 01:23:39,285
What do you say ?

1202
01:23:39,369 --> 01:23:41,162
Ah...

1203
01:23:41,246 --> 01:23:44,374
I think I'd be
a little afraid.

1204
01:23:44,457 --> 01:23:46,626
Of what ?

1205
01:23:46,709 --> 01:23:50,964
Afraid of making
a mistake.

1206
01:23:51,047 --> 01:23:55,343
No mistakes in the tango,
not like life.

1207
01:23:55,426 --> 01:23:58,012
It's simple. That's what makes
the tango so great.

1208
01:23:58,096 --> 01:24:02,934
If you make a mistake,
get all tangled up, just tango on.

1209
01:24:03,017 --> 01:24:06,521
Why don't you try ?

1210
01:24:10,316 --> 01:24:12,944
Will you try it ?

1211
01:24:13,027 --> 01:24:16,531
All right.
I'll give it a try.

1212
01:24:16,614 --> 01:24:19,284
Hold me down, son.

1213
01:24:26,332 --> 01:24:28,793
Your arm.

1214
01:24:30,587 --> 01:24:33,214
Charlie,

1215
01:24:33,298 --> 01:24:35,842
I'm gonna need some
coordinates here, son.

1216
01:24:35,925 --> 01:24:38,886
The floor's
about 20 by 30,

1217
01:24:38,970 --> 01:24:41,931
And you're at
the long end.

1218
01:24:42,015 --> 01:24:46,019
There's tables on the outside.
The band's on the right.

1219
01:27:24,844 --> 01:27:29,515
Oh, Frank, you are
one incredible dancer.

1220
01:27:32,060 --> 01:27:35,730
Wait'll you see
Charlie dance.

1221
01:27:35,813 --> 01:27:38,942
- He's a liar. I don't dance.
- Isn't he a charmer, though ?

1222
01:27:39,025 --> 01:27:43,196
Truth is, not only can he dance,
but he'll sing you a hell of a tune.

1223
01:27:43,279 --> 01:27:45,949
He can do bird calls
and imitate Bela Lugosi.

1224
01:27:46,032 --> 01:27:48,076
- Hi, honey.
- Hey.

1225
01:27:48,159 --> 01:27:51,788
Michael, this is Frank
and this is Charlie.

1226
01:27:51,871 --> 01:27:55,500
-Hi, Frank, Charlie. I'm sorry I'm late.
-Oh, that's okay.

1227
01:27:55,583 --> 01:27:58,294
These two gentlemen
entertained me,

1228
01:27:58,336 --> 01:28:00,964
and time flew.

1229
01:28:01,047 --> 01:28:04,842
Your girl is...
a hell of a tango dancer.

1230
01:28:04,926 --> 01:28:07,553
You found someone to tango with.
That's terrific !

1231
01:28:07,637 --> 01:28:09,639
Let me
shake your hand.

1232
01:28:09,722 --> 01:28:12,976
- No, it was Frank.
- Hell, I'll shake both your hands !

1233
01:28:14,477 --> 01:28:17,272
Honey, this looks like the place,
but we gotta go.

1234
01:28:17,355 --> 01:28:20,441
We got a date with Darryl
and Carol in the village.

1235
01:28:20,525 --> 01:28:22,443
Do you have a check ?

1236
01:28:22,527 --> 01:28:27,198
- Michael, please. My pleasure.
- No, no. I got this.

1237
01:28:27,282 --> 01:28:30,118
Michael, get your hand outta
your pocket. I'll take it. Really.

1238
01:28:30,201 --> 01:28:33,705
Allow me.

1239
01:28:33,788 --> 01:28:36,332
Why, thank you.

1240
01:28:36,374 --> 01:28:38,376
Bye, guys.

1241
01:28:38,418 --> 01:28:40,587
Bye.

1242
01:28:47,760 --> 01:28:51,598
Darryl and Carol.
Yeah.

1243
01:28:59,564 --> 01:29:02,859
It's Apartment 17 E, Colonel..
She's expecting you.

1244
01:29:02,942 --> 01:29:06,863
You don't have to worry about a thing.
She's the creme de la creme.

1245
01:29:06,905 --> 01:29:09,407
My buddy took the Vice Chancellor
of Germany to her.

1246
01:29:09,490 --> 01:29:11,910
Now he wants to immigrate
to this country.

1247
01:29:11,993 --> 01:29:14,037
You did good, hombre.

1248
01:29:16,414 --> 01:29:19,250
My hair,
how is it ?

1249
01:29:19,292 --> 01:29:21,252
It's perfect.

1250
01:29:24,088 --> 01:29:28,301
- I got the red foulard okay, didn't I ?
- Yeah, real dark red.

1251
01:29:28,384 --> 01:29:30,762
Burgundy, Charlie,
burgundy.

1252
01:29:30,845 --> 01:29:33,723
They love it.

1253
01:29:33,765 --> 01:29:36,392
Bay Rum.

1254
01:29:37,393 --> 01:29:40,438
Windsor knot.

1255
01:29:40,521 --> 01:29:43,399
That's my heart
I'm feelin'.

1256
01:29:52,158 --> 01:29:54,160
I'm off.

1257
01:30:12,345 --> 01:30:14,305
Can you get long distance
on this ?

1258
01:30:14,389 --> 01:30:16,391
And how.
Be my guest.

1259
01:30:27,860 --> 01:30:30,738
- Sugarbush lodge.
- Hi. George Willis, please ?

1260
01:30:30,822 --> 01:30:33,408
One moment, please.

1261
01:30:34,200 --> 01:30:36,160
- Hello ?
- Ah, Harry ?

1262
01:30:36,244 --> 01:30:38,496
Chas, how are you ?

1263
01:30:38,580 --> 01:30:41,749
You just caught us. We're about
to shoot George over to the airport.

1264
01:30:41,833 --> 01:30:44,669
Why is George
going to the airport ?

1265
01:30:44,711 --> 01:30:48,089
Um, hold on. Maybe you should talk
to the man himself.

1266
01:30:49,382 --> 01:30:51,426
- Chas.
- Yeah. Hi, George.

1267
01:30:51,509 --> 01:30:55,471
- You just caught me.
- Harry said. Where you goin' ?

1268
01:30:55,555 --> 01:30:58,057
- Home.
- To Boston ?

1269
01:30:58,141 --> 01:31:01,019
Catching the puddle jumper.
Keep your fingers crossed.

1270
01:31:01,102 --> 01:31:04,606
What are you
going home for ?

1271
01:31:04,689 --> 01:31:08,443
I was thinking, Chas..
This asshole, Trask ?

1272
01:31:08,526 --> 01:31:11,195
He's making
no sense at all.

1273
01:31:11,279 --> 01:31:15,033
Somebody's gotta talk to him.
My father's Class of '59.

1274
01:31:15,074 --> 01:31:18,912
Your father ? I thought we were
gonna keep our parents outta this.

1275
01:31:18,995 --> 01:31:23,249
This guy Trask is outta control, Chas.
Outta control !

1276
01:31:23,333 --> 01:31:25,627
Somebody's gotta
talk to him.

1277
01:31:25,710 --> 01:31:29,672
- My father's a major
fund-raiser, you know.
- No, I didn't.

1278
01:31:29,756 --> 01:31:33,509
Just relax.
He'll get us off the hook.

1279
01:31:33,593 --> 01:31:36,721
- I gotta go. Everything all right ?
- Sure.

1280
01:31:36,804 --> 01:31:40,683
- I'll see you Monday. Good-bye.
- Bye.

1281
01:32:04,958 --> 01:32:07,418
- Good night, sir.
- Good night.

1282
01:32:19,305 --> 01:32:21,266
Hiya, Charlie.

1283
01:32:22,809 --> 01:32:24,811
Watch the door.

1284
01:32:42,704 --> 01:32:45,248
What a beautiful woman.

1285
01:32:58,469 --> 01:33:02,432
- Hello, there.
- Do you see what I see ?

1286
01:33:02,515 --> 01:33:05,643
Yeah..
Either there's something wrong,

1287
01:33:05,727 --> 01:33:08,146
or we got the
world's worst hangover.

1288
01:33:08,229 --> 01:33:12,400
Won't you come in ?

1289
01:33:30,418 --> 01:33:32,378
Colonel ?

1290
01:33:44,974 --> 01:33:48,269
Colonel,
you all right ?

1291
01:33:48,353 --> 01:33:51,189
What is there ?

1292
01:33:54,776 --> 01:33:59,989
It's afternoon.
You've been sleeping all morning.

1293
01:34:00,073 --> 01:34:02,700
So what ?

1294
01:34:02,784 --> 01:34:06,412
I don't know.
I thought --

1295
01:34:10,792 --> 01:34:12,835
I-l talked to George
last night.

1296
01:34:12,919 --> 01:34:15,129
His, ah --

1297
01:34:15,213 --> 01:34:19,592
His father's a big-deal alumnus
at school. He's got a lot of pull.

1298
01:34:19,676 --> 01:34:22,720
Really ?

1299
01:34:22,804 --> 01:34:26,558
Yeah, he's, ah,

1300
01:34:26,641 --> 01:34:28,935
he's gonna talk
to the headmaster.

1301
01:34:29,018 --> 01:34:32,313
George thinks he might
be able to get us off the hook.

1302
01:34:32,397 --> 01:34:35,066
"Get us off the hook."

1303
01:34:35,149 --> 01:34:37,902
Yeah, that's --
that's what he said.

1304
01:34:37,944 --> 01:34:41,781
Watch the "us" part.

1305
01:34:43,616 --> 01:34:46,452
Colonel, don't you wanna
get up and do something ?

1306
01:34:50,665 --> 01:34:52,500
Colonel ?

1307
01:34:52,584 --> 01:34:56,170
Oh, Charlie,
what do ya want ?

1308
01:34:56,254 --> 01:34:58,214
I don't know !

1309
01:34:58,298 --> 01:35:01,426
But you're
making me nervous.

1310
01:35:04,387 --> 01:35:07,557
My wallet is on
the dresser.

1311
01:35:07,640 --> 01:35:09,851
Take out
your plane ticket...

1312
01:35:09,934 --> 01:35:14,772
and $400
mustering-out pay,

1313
01:35:14,814 --> 01:35:17,233
plus...

1314
01:35:17,317 --> 01:35:21,696
airport-to-school taxi.

1315
01:35:23,156 --> 01:35:26,242
Colonel, it's no rush.
I mean, I can --

1316
01:35:26,326 --> 01:35:28,328
I could stay
for a while.

1317
01:35:28,411 --> 01:35:32,290
Charlie, you already
gave me a day.

1318
01:35:32,332 --> 01:35:36,294
For that day,
I am eternally grateful.

1319
01:35:38,087 --> 01:35:42,800
But right now I have...
other plans.

1320
01:35:42,884 --> 01:35:45,511
What other plans
do you have ?

1321
01:35:47,639 --> 01:35:49,641
To die, son.

1322
01:35:49,724 --> 01:35:53,853
Colonel, you're --

1323
01:35:53,937 --> 01:35:56,648
Come on, Colonel,
you're not gonna die today.

1324
01:35:56,689 --> 01:36:00,485
Charlie,
give me your hand.

1325
01:36:04,364 --> 01:36:06,991
You go now, boy.
Okay ?

1326
01:36:08,826 --> 01:36:11,871
You go.
Just, uh --

1327
01:36:14,457 --> 01:36:16,793
Just leave me
sleep here.

1328
01:36:17,877 --> 01:36:21,047
Look, uh --
Can we start over, please ?

1329
01:36:21,130 --> 01:36:25,343
What do you feel
like doin' today, huh ?

1330
01:36:25,426 --> 01:36:27,929
I mean, look at this.
The sun is shining !

1331
01:36:28,012 --> 01:36:30,473
It's a beautiful day.
Let's --

1332
01:36:33,810 --> 01:36:37,313
Colonel, I know you don't want
to be a party poop,

1333
01:36:37,397 --> 01:36:41,401
so let's go out and do something, huh ?
Let's go for a ride.

1334
01:36:46,656 --> 01:36:48,783
Yeah, a ride.

1335
01:36:48,866 --> 01:36:52,078
A ride ?

1336
01:36:52,161 --> 01:36:55,873
Yeah, Colonel Slade,
what do you say ?

1337
01:36:55,957 --> 01:36:59,002
Let's go for a ride,
huh ?

1338
01:37:05,758 --> 01:37:08,094
What kind of ride ?

1339
01:37:09,512 --> 01:37:11,723
Yeah, this is a valid
Oregon driver's license,

1340
01:37:12,265 --> 01:37:15,727
and we let appropriate customers
test-drive the Testarossa.

1341
01:37:15,810 --> 01:37:19,814
But you're 17 and with
a blind companion. That we don't do.

1342
01:37:19,898 --> 01:37:22,817
This is a $190,000
piece of machinery.

1343
01:37:22,901 --> 01:37:26,279
- I'm not letting it out this door.
- How 'bout this one over here ?

1344
01:37:26,362 --> 01:37:29,198
That's a Cabriolet T.
The same deal.

1345
01:37:29,282 --> 01:37:33,578
Think I'm gonna let an unaccompanied kid
get behind the wheel of a $110,000 car ?

1346
01:37:33,661 --> 01:37:36,164
He will not be
unaccompanied.

1347
01:37:36,247 --> 01:37:39,834
I'll be with him.
I'm his father.

1348
01:37:39,918 --> 01:37:42,879
- You're his father ?
- Yes.

1349
01:37:42,962 --> 01:37:46,257
I have an idea. Why don't I take
your father for a test-drive ?

1350
01:37:46,341 --> 01:37:50,261
- What's your quota, Freddie ?
- Don't worry about my quota. I do well.

1351
01:37:50,303 --> 01:37:52,347
How many Ferraris
you sold this month ?

1352
01:37:52,430 --> 01:37:55,099
That's not relevant
to this discussion.

1353
01:37:55,183 --> 01:37:57,268
Freddie,
the 80s are over.

1354
01:37:57,352 --> 01:38:00,063
Are you tryin' to tell me
these are just walkin' outta the store ?

1355
01:38:00,146 --> 01:38:04,317
This is a Ferrari, the finest machinery
made in the automobile industry.

1356
01:38:04,400 --> 01:38:07,278
If you like it that much,
why are you sellin' it ?

1357
01:38:07,362 --> 01:38:12,200
- I'd love to accommodate you --
- If this car performs
the way I expect it to,

1358
01:38:12,283 --> 01:38:17,747
you'll get a certified check of $101,000
and change when in you come tomorrow.

1359
01:38:17,830 --> 01:38:22,377
It's $109,000,
plus $950, plus tax.

1360
01:38:22,460 --> 01:38:25,421
Freddie, for you...

1361
01:38:25,505 --> 01:38:27,674
107 all in,

1362
01:38:27,757 --> 01:38:31,302
plus a case of champagne
to go with your leftover turkey.

1363
01:38:31,386 --> 01:38:35,306
What do you say ?
Don't worry about the boy.

1364
01:38:35,348 --> 01:38:38,977
He drives so smooth,
you can boil an egg on the engine.

1365
01:38:39,060 --> 01:38:42,146
When we bring the car back,
I'll peel the egg for ya.

1366
01:38:42,230 --> 01:38:46,192
Listen, you made me laugh,
but I can't let the car go out.

1367
01:38:48,278 --> 01:38:50,238
Want a deposit ?

1368
01:38:50,321 --> 01:38:53,283
This is not an
installment item, sir.

1369
01:38:56,452 --> 01:39:00,456
Freddie, you're no
spring chicken, are ya ?

1370
01:39:02,166 --> 01:39:06,421
Well, you know what they call me
at the home office ? The gray ghost.

1371
01:39:06,504 --> 01:39:08,840
You know why they
still keep me around ?

1372
01:39:08,881 --> 01:39:12,260
There's no kid here that
can move a Ferrari like I can.

1373
01:39:12,343 --> 01:39:15,221
I'm known from coast to coast
like butter and toast.

1374
01:39:15,305 --> 01:39:17,557
Ask anybody about
Freddie Bisco.

1375
01:39:17,640 --> 01:39:20,560
When I get a Ferrari...
out the door !

1376
01:39:20,643 --> 01:39:24,272
- Hah ! You just made me laugh.
- Yeah ?

1377
01:39:24,355 --> 01:39:28,234
Two thousand.

1378
01:39:28,318 --> 01:39:31,195
Unless you take it,
you're gonna make me cry.

1379
01:39:34,490 --> 01:39:37,535
I'm a gray ghost too.

1380
01:39:47,712 --> 01:39:50,798
See ? This is fun,
isn't it ?

1381
01:40:03,895 --> 01:40:07,273
- Drop her into neutral.

1382
01:40:07,357 --> 01:40:10,318
Slide her into second.
Pop the clutch.

1383
01:40:48,439 --> 01:40:52,193
Straight. Hold it
right like that. Feel it ?

1384
01:40:52,235 --> 01:40:55,822
That's straight.
Just keep it straight.

1385
01:40:58,408 --> 01:41:01,411
- Keep it straight.
- No fun just to keep it straight.

1386
01:41:01,494 --> 01:41:04,789
You've got to move a little bit,
feel the road.

1387
01:41:04,872 --> 01:41:07,875
Please ? Just like this.
All right ? There you go.

1388
01:41:07,917 --> 01:41:10,878
Take it nice and easy.

1389
01:41:10,920 --> 01:41:13,965
Do you like this ?

1390
01:41:16,092 --> 01:41:19,429
Slow it down a little.
You goin' a little fast.

1391
01:41:19,512 --> 01:41:22,932
Colonel, slow it down.

1392
01:41:23,016 --> 01:41:25,393
Something's happened
to my foot !

1393
01:41:26,978 --> 01:41:28,938
- Slow it down, please.
- Hold on, Charlie.

1394
01:41:29,022 --> 01:41:31,190
I think I've got
another gear.

1395
01:41:31,274 --> 01:41:33,026
Colonel Slade ?

1396
01:41:35,111 --> 01:41:37,488
- Whoo-ah !
- Oh shit !

1397
01:41:37,572 --> 01:41:40,283
Watch out !

1398
01:41:40,366 --> 01:41:42,327
Hah-hah !

1399
01:41:42,410 --> 01:41:44,621
You'll get us killed !

1400
01:41:44,704 --> 01:41:48,666
Don't blame me, Charlie.
I can't see !

1401
01:41:48,750 --> 01:41:51,711
Colonel, slow it down !

1402
01:41:59,802 --> 01:42:02,639
Oh, God.
Oh, Jesus !

1403
01:42:02,680 --> 01:42:05,475
Now let's see
how this baby corners.

1404
01:42:05,558 --> 01:42:08,519
- Corners ?
- Yeah. Say when.

1405
01:42:08,603 --> 01:42:11,231
- Say when what ?
- Say when to turn.

1406
01:42:11,314 --> 01:42:14,776
- Colonel, you can't turn the car.
- Where's the turn, Charlie ?

1407
01:42:14,859 --> 01:42:18,905
3:00 ? 2:00 ?
Right oblique ? Right face ?

1408
01:42:18,988 --> 01:42:20,698
Come on !
Talk to me !

1409
01:42:20,782 --> 01:42:23,159
Ah... it's left, I guess.

1410
01:42:23,243 --> 01:42:25,954
Left. I knew it.
Okay. Now ?

1411
01:42:28,081 --> 01:42:30,667
No, no !
Not now ! Not now !

1412
01:42:30,750 --> 01:42:33,586
- Now ?
- Colonel, please ?

1413
01:42:33,670 --> 01:42:37,924
Charlie, I'm gonna do it anyway.
Whether you say so or not, here we go !

1414
01:42:38,007 --> 01:42:40,593
Okay ! Wait, wait, wait !
Just wait !

1415
01:42:40,677 --> 01:42:42,845
Here I go.

1416
01:42:42,887 --> 01:42:44,847
Wait... now !

1417
01:42:50,728 --> 01:42:54,107
I did it !
Oh, Charlie !

1418
01:42:55,692 --> 01:42:57,944
You're ridin' with
one very happy man !

1419
01:43:00,280 --> 01:43:02,407
- Turn again !
- Be specific, son.

1420
01:43:03,700 --> 01:43:05,618
- Left now !
- Okay.

1421
01:43:07,036 --> 01:43:09,914
- Ohh !
- Whoo-ah !

1422
01:43:09,998 --> 01:43:12,709
I love this !

1423
01:43:12,792 --> 01:43:16,838
I love it !
Shall we take it to the max ?

1424
01:43:16,921 --> 01:43:19,257
Let me out.

1425
01:43:19,340 --> 01:43:23,845
- Shit ! The yellow flag.

1426
01:43:23,928 --> 01:43:26,055
I hadn't even
opened her up yet.

1427
01:43:26,139 --> 01:43:28,433
- Which way's the curb ?
- Pull over. Slow down !

1428
01:43:28,516 --> 01:43:30,476
- Slow down, Colonel.
- All right, I'm doin' it.

1429
01:43:30,560 --> 01:43:33,813
- Pull over to the curb. Slow it down.
- Yep, yep. Got it.

1430
01:43:45,520 --> 01:43:49,398
- Oh, Christ.
- Ooh, I haven't had a ticket in years.

1431
01:43:52,276 --> 01:43:54,862
I'll do the talking.

1432
01:44:00,284 --> 01:44:02,245
License and registration.

1433
01:44:13,631 --> 01:44:16,467
What ? Are you
test-driving this baby ?

1434
01:44:16,551 --> 01:44:18,594
Don't she purr though ?

1435
01:44:18,678 --> 01:44:20,972
At 70 miles an hour ?

1436
01:44:21,055 --> 01:44:24,350
You should hear her
at 125. Hah !

1437
01:44:24,434 --> 01:44:27,437
Where's your license ?

1438
01:44:27,478 --> 01:44:29,605
At the dealer's.

1439
01:44:29,689 --> 01:44:33,025
They give it back
when you return the car.

1440
01:44:33,109 --> 01:44:36,737
- You got I.D. ?
- You bet.

1441
01:44:38,739 --> 01:44:40,783
Indeed.

1442
01:44:43,995 --> 01:44:45,913
Lt. Col. Slade.

1443
01:44:45,997 --> 01:44:47,915
And you, solider ?

1444
01:44:47,999 --> 01:44:51,961
The name is
police officer Gore.

1445
01:44:52,044 --> 01:44:55,256
Doin' a hell of a job, Gore.

1446
01:44:55,339 --> 01:44:59,802
And so are you, Colonel.
Who's the kid ?

1447
01:44:59,886 --> 01:45:03,139
My boy Charlie.

1448
01:45:03,222 --> 01:45:05,183
He kept tellin' me to
"Let her out."

1449
01:45:05,266 --> 01:45:07,268
What was I gonna do,
disappoint him ?

1450
01:45:07,351 --> 01:45:08,936
Yes.

1451
01:45:13,065 --> 01:45:17,737
Tell you what I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna let you go on one condition.

1452
01:45:17,820 --> 01:45:22,492
- What's that ?
- You take this rig
straight back to the dealer.

1453
01:45:24,702 --> 01:45:28,206
- Y-You got it.
- Shut up.

1454
01:45:28,289 --> 01:45:33,461
- You want this ?
- Sure. Gore ?

1455
01:45:33,544 --> 01:45:37,006
Your face and your voice
are familiar.

1456
01:45:37,090 --> 01:45:39,383
You ever in the
officer's club at Da Nang ?

1457
01:45:39,467 --> 01:45:41,594
No.

1458
01:45:41,677 --> 01:45:46,933
- Never in the army ?
- No. Coast Guard.

1459
01:45:47,016 --> 01:45:51,395
Good Lord.
Hah ! Hah !

1460
01:45:54,357 --> 01:45:56,567
Your dad is looking good,
Charlie.

1461
01:45:56,651 --> 01:46:01,114
He's got a heavy foot.
Tell him to take it light. All right ?

1462
01:46:01,197 --> 01:46:04,700
- I hear ya !
- Thanks.

1463
01:46:17,547 --> 01:46:20,925
Get out of the car, 'cause
you are not driving anymore.

1464
01:46:21,008 --> 01:46:23,761
Just keeping this baby warm,
that's all.

1465
01:46:25,555 --> 01:46:28,433
I'm not drivin' anymore.

1466
01:46:32,061 --> 01:46:34,188
Yes.

1467
01:46:38,109 --> 01:46:40,862
- Take my arm.
- I'm okay.

1468
01:46:40,945 --> 01:46:45,575
- Colonel, it's really bumpy here.
- Yeah, bumpy.

1469
01:46:57,128 --> 01:46:59,088
You all right ?

1470
01:47:02,467 --> 01:47:04,719
Yeah.

1471
01:47:11,559 --> 01:47:14,228
Red light.
Hold it.

1472
01:47:18,816 --> 01:47:20,860
Taking too long.

1473
01:47:24,989 --> 01:47:27,950
Shit ! Colonel !
Colonel ?

1474
01:47:38,669 --> 01:47:40,630
Colonel !

1475
01:47:40,671 --> 01:47:43,257
Shit !
You all right ?

1476
01:47:43,341 --> 01:47:45,593
What the hell
are you doing ?

1477
01:47:45,676 --> 01:47:47,595
- Take the cane.
- I gotta take a piss.

1478
01:47:47,678 --> 01:47:50,306
- Take the cane, Colonel.
- It happens to the best of us.

1479
01:47:50,389 --> 01:47:52,600
We're on Park Avenue.
You can't go to the bathroom.

1480
01:47:52,683 --> 01:47:56,187
- Perfect place.
- You'll get arrested.

1481
01:47:56,270 --> 01:47:58,397
Never been housebroken.
Ohh !

1482
01:47:58,481 --> 01:48:00,900
Shit !

1483
01:48:00,983 --> 01:48:03,069
What's the matter
with you, Colonel ?

1484
01:48:09,575 --> 01:48:12,870
What are you doing ?
Stand up.

1485
01:48:12,954 --> 01:48:15,706
Come on.

1486
01:48:15,748 --> 01:48:18,835
I'm tired, Charlie.
I'm tired.

1487
01:48:20,545 --> 01:48:22,880
Give me your arm.

1488
01:48:22,922 --> 01:48:25,800
Here's your cane.

1489
01:48:25,883 --> 01:48:28,845
Take me back
to the hotel, son.

1490
01:48:34,058 --> 01:48:36,811
Home at last.

1491
01:48:57,165 --> 01:48:59,125
You all right now ?

1492
01:49:00,877 --> 01:49:03,838
Yeah.

1493
01:49:05,882 --> 01:49:10,678
- Do you want to use the bathroom ?
- No.

1494
01:49:18,394 --> 01:49:21,522
- Can I get you something ?
- No.

1495
01:49:25,234 --> 01:49:28,613
- You sure you're all right ?
- I'm fine, Charlie.

1496
01:49:46,380 --> 01:49:49,133
Do you mind
if I use the phone ?

1497
01:49:49,217 --> 01:49:51,552
Go ahead.

1498
01:50:09,695 --> 01:50:12,740
- Hello ?
- Hi, is George there, please ?

1499
01:50:12,824 --> 01:50:15,326
Senior or Junior ?

1500
01:50:15,409 --> 01:50:17,328
Junior.

1501
01:50:17,411 --> 01:50:20,540
- Who's this ?
- A friend of his from school.

1502
01:50:20,623 --> 01:50:25,128
George isn't going to be talking
to any friends from school right now.

1503
01:50:26,963 --> 01:50:30,466
- Oh.
- Good-bye.

1504
01:50:45,940 --> 01:50:49,110
Colonel, are you
looking at me ?

1505
01:50:51,988 --> 01:50:55,074
I'm blind, Charlie.

1506
01:50:59,996 --> 01:51:03,207
I'm gonna take a nap.

1507
01:51:04,792 --> 01:51:07,211
Too much fresh air.

1508
01:51:07,295 --> 01:51:09,881
It's probably
a good idea.

1509
01:51:11,174 --> 01:51:14,135
Want me to help you
to your room ?

1510
01:51:14,177 --> 01:51:16,512
No.

1511
01:51:16,554 --> 01:51:18,806
Couch.

1512
01:51:18,848 --> 01:51:22,143
I like
this couch here.

1513
01:51:24,103 --> 01:51:26,439
You sure you're
all right, Colonel ?

1514
01:51:26,522 --> 01:51:28,483
I got a headache.

1515
01:51:34,447 --> 01:51:37,617
Why don't you go downstairs,
get me some Aspirin, Charlie ?

1516
01:51:37,700 --> 01:51:42,038
- Some Aspirin.
- Yeah. Also...

1517
01:51:43,581 --> 01:51:46,709
I feel like
a cigar.

1518
01:51:46,793 --> 01:51:51,339
Get me a couple of
Monte Cristos, number one.

1519
01:51:51,380 --> 01:51:53,883
- Monte Cristos, number one.
- Yeah.

1520
01:51:53,966 --> 01:51:56,803
You won't be able to get 'em
at the newsstand downstairs.

1521
01:51:56,886 --> 01:51:59,639
So why don't you
go over to...

1522
01:51:59,722 --> 01:52:02,850
Fiftieth and Fifth,
Dunhill's.

1523
01:52:02,892 --> 01:52:06,604
Fella name of Arnold
in the humidor.

1524
01:52:06,687 --> 01:52:10,191
Tell him, um,
they're for me.

1525
01:52:10,274 --> 01:52:12,235
He'll know.

1526
01:53:01,075 --> 01:53:02,952
You're back
too fast.

1527
01:53:05,955 --> 01:53:08,374
You didn't get
my cigars, did you ?

1528
01:53:13,546 --> 01:53:15,673
Get out of here,
Charlie.

1529
01:53:19,385 --> 01:53:21,387
I thought we had a deal.

1530
01:53:21,471 --> 01:53:26,893
I welched. I'm a welcher.
Didn't I tell you ?

1531
01:53:26,976 --> 01:53:30,521
No, what you told me was that
you gave me all the bullets.

1532
01:53:30,605 --> 01:53:33,065
I lied.

1533
01:53:34,859 --> 01:53:37,779
- Yeah, well, you could have fooled me.
- And I did.

1534
01:53:40,990 --> 01:53:44,577
Charlie, how you ever gonna survive
in this world without me ?

1535
01:53:49,165 --> 01:53:52,877
Why don't you just
give me the gun, all right ?

1536
01:54:00,551 --> 01:54:02,512
Wh-- What are you doing ?

1537
01:54:04,680 --> 01:54:06,724
I'm gonna
shoot you too.

1538
01:54:09,477 --> 01:54:11,687
Your life's finished anyway.

1539
01:54:11,729 --> 01:54:15,691
Your friend George's gonna
sing like a canary.

1540
01:54:15,733 --> 01:54:17,693
And so are you.

1541
01:54:17,735 --> 01:54:20,488
And once you've sung,
Charlie, my boy,

1542
01:54:20,571 --> 01:54:24,742
you're gonna take your place
on that long, gray line...

1543
01:54:24,826 --> 01:54:26,869
of American manhood.

1544
01:54:28,371 --> 01:54:31,541
And you will be through.

1545
01:54:31,624 --> 01:54:33,960
I'd like to disagree
with you, Colonel.

1546
01:54:34,043 --> 01:54:36,963
You're in no position
to disagree with me, boy.

1547
01:54:37,046 --> 01:54:40,508
I got a loaded .45 here.
You got pimples.

1548
01:54:40,591 --> 01:54:45,430
I'm gonna kill ya, Charlie,
because I can't bear the thought...

1549
01:54:45,513 --> 01:54:47,932
of you sellin' out !

1550
01:54:48,015 --> 01:54:51,227
Put the gun down,
all right, Colonel ?

1551
01:54:51,269 --> 01:54:54,730
What ? You givin' me
an ultimatum ?

1552
01:54:54,772 --> 01:54:57,358
No, I'm --

1553
01:54:57,400 --> 01:55:00,027
I give the ultimatums !

1554
01:55:01,446 --> 01:55:03,406
I'm sorry.

1555
01:55:04,574 --> 01:55:06,492
All right ?
I'm sorry.

1556
01:55:09,829 --> 01:55:13,541
It's all right...
Charlie.

1557
01:55:19,005 --> 01:55:21,257
You break my heart, son.

1558
01:55:22,675 --> 01:55:24,594
All my life
I stood up...

1559
01:55:24,677 --> 01:55:28,681
to everyone
and everything...

1560
01:55:28,765 --> 01:55:32,935
because it made me feel
important.

1561
01:55:34,979 --> 01:55:37,982
You do it
'cause you mean it.

1562
01:55:40,526 --> 01:55:42,445
You got integrity, Charlie.

1563
01:55:46,657 --> 01:55:49,869
I don't know whether
to shoot ya or adopt ya.

1564
01:55:51,954 --> 01:55:54,999
Not much of a choice,
is it, sir ?

1565
01:55:55,082 --> 01:55:57,794
Aw, don't get cute now.

1566
01:55:57,877 --> 01:56:02,048
- Colonel, please put the gun away ?
- I asked you a question.

1567
01:56:02,131 --> 01:56:04,926
Do you want me to adopt ya,
or don't ya ?

1568
01:56:06,219 --> 01:56:09,263
Please ? I mean...

1569
01:56:09,347 --> 01:56:13,309
- you're just in a slump right now.
- Slump ?

1570
01:56:15,812 --> 01:56:17,897
No slump, Charlie.

1571
01:56:19,899 --> 01:56:21,818
I'm bad.

1572
01:56:24,237 --> 01:56:26,155
I'm not bad. No.

1573
01:56:28,699 --> 01:56:30,660
I'm rotten.

1574
01:56:33,538 --> 01:56:35,498
You're not bad.

1575
01:56:38,084 --> 01:56:40,378
Y-- You're just in pain.

1576
01:56:45,967 --> 01:56:48,344
What do you know
about pain ?

1577
01:56:49,971 --> 01:56:53,933
Hmm ? You little
snail darter...

1578
01:56:54,016 --> 01:56:56,227
from the Pacific Northwest.

1579
01:56:57,687 --> 01:57:00,398
What the fuck you know
about pain ?

1580
01:57:03,109 --> 01:57:05,069
Let me have the gun, Colonel.

1581
01:57:05,153 --> 01:57:08,281
No time to grow a dick, son.

1582
01:57:08,364 --> 01:57:11,617
Just, just give me
the gun, all right, Colonel ?

1583
01:57:13,870 --> 01:57:16,747
I'm talkin'
a parade ground. Ten-hut !

1584
01:57:20,460 --> 01:57:23,838
Soldier, that was
a direct order.

1585
01:57:25,298 --> 01:57:27,300
Give me the gun ?

1586
01:57:30,845 --> 01:57:34,640
You can stay
or you can leave.

1587
01:57:34,724 --> 01:57:39,562
You understand ?
Either way, I'm gonna do this thing.

1588
01:57:41,939 --> 01:57:45,693
Now why don't you leave
and spare yourself ?

1589
01:57:48,738 --> 01:57:51,032
I want your gun, Colonel.

1590
01:57:59,665 --> 01:58:02,376
I'm gonna give myself
a count.

1591
01:58:07,131 --> 01:58:09,842
You need a count
for balance.

1592
01:58:13,221 --> 01:58:16,849
Five, four...

1593
01:58:16,933 --> 01:58:19,519
three...

1594
01:58:22,313 --> 01:58:24,273
two...

1595
01:58:26,275 --> 01:58:29,654
one. Fuck it.

1596
01:58:37,578 --> 01:58:40,039
Gimme ! Fuck it !

1597
01:58:43,292 --> 01:58:45,420
- Get out of here !
- I'm stayin' right here !

1598
01:58:45,503 --> 01:58:48,214
- Get outta here !
- I'm stayin' right here.

1599
01:58:48,297 --> 01:58:51,426
- I'll blow your fuckin' head off !
- Then do it !

1600
01:58:51,467 --> 01:58:53,719
You want to do it ?
Do it ! Let's go.

1601
01:58:54,804 --> 01:58:56,681
- Fuck.

1602
01:58:59,809 --> 01:59:02,728
Get outta here !

1603
01:59:03,855 --> 01:59:06,232
You fucked up, all right ?
So what ?

1604
01:59:06,315 --> 01:59:10,153
So everybody does it.
Get on with your life, would ya ?

1605
01:59:10,236 --> 01:59:14,949
What life ?
I got no life !

1606
01:59:16,909 --> 01:59:19,162
I'm in the dark here !

1607
01:59:20,997 --> 01:59:25,001
You understand ?
I'm in the dark !

1608
01:59:31,132 --> 01:59:34,844
So give up. You want
to give up, give up...

1609
01:59:34,886 --> 01:59:36,846
'cause I'm givin' up too.

1610
01:59:36,888 --> 01:59:38,848
You said I'm through.
You're right.

1611
01:59:38,931 --> 01:59:40,850
We're both through.
It's all over.

1612
01:59:40,933 --> 01:59:44,520
So let's get on with it.
Let's fuckin' do it.

1613
01:59:44,604 --> 01:59:49,233
Let's fuckin' pull the trigger,
you miserable blind motherfucker.

1614
01:59:57,700 --> 01:59:59,994
Pull the trigger.

1615
02:00:01,204 --> 02:00:03,122
Here we go, Charlie.

1616
02:00:04,373 --> 02:00:06,292
I'm ready.

1617
02:00:14,133 --> 02:00:17,095
You don't want to die.

1618
02:00:18,387 --> 02:00:20,973
And neither do you.

1619
02:00:23,601 --> 02:00:27,271
Give me one reason not to.

1620
02:00:30,983 --> 02:00:34,362
I'll give you two. you can
dance the tango and drive a Ferrari...

1621
02:00:34,403 --> 02:00:36,697
better than anyone
I've ever seen.

1622
02:00:42,328 --> 02:00:44,747
You never seen anyone
do either.

1623
02:00:48,918 --> 02:00:50,878
Give me the gun, Colonel.

1624
02:01:02,098 --> 02:01:04,642
Oh, where do I go
from here, Charlie ?

1625
02:01:05,768 --> 02:01:08,729
If you're tangled up,
just tango on.

1626
02:01:11,774 --> 02:01:14,735
You askin' me
to dance, Charlie ?

1627
02:01:21,284 --> 02:01:25,621
?Did you ever have the feelin'
that you wanted to go ?

1628
02:01:27,415 --> 02:01:31,711
?And still had the feelin'
that you wanted to stay §§

1629
02:01:48,436 --> 02:01:51,439
You like my blues, Charlie ?

1630
02:01:53,733 --> 02:01:56,152
Yeah, they're beautiful.

1631
02:01:57,278 --> 02:02:02,408
I wore these for
Lyndon's inauguration.

1632
02:02:05,244 --> 02:02:09,290
Of course, uh, we weren't
the number one ball.

1633
02:02:12,877 --> 02:02:14,879
But he dropped by anyway.

1634
02:02:17,632 --> 02:02:20,176
Will you please
give me the gun ?

1635
02:02:23,930 --> 02:02:28,851
You're askin' an officer
to surrender his side arm.

1636
02:02:30,728 --> 02:02:34,774
You don't have to surrender it.
You just put it down for a little while.

1637
02:02:36,192 --> 02:02:39,195
All right ?
Just put it down.

1638
02:02:49,330 --> 02:02:52,625
Boy, I could use
a drink, Charlie.

1639
02:02:56,003 --> 02:02:58,840
How about a cup of coffee ?

1640
02:02:58,923 --> 02:03:03,845
Too big a leap for me
right now, Charlie.

1641
02:03:03,928 --> 02:03:06,431
Maybe tomorrow. Hah !

1642
02:03:08,474 --> 02:03:12,728
No, a Mr. John Daniels
would be preferred.

1643
02:03:15,356 --> 02:03:17,900
No water, Charlie.

1644
02:03:19,152 --> 02:03:21,112
No water.

1645
02:03:21,195 --> 02:03:23,197
Please.

1646
02:03:31,205 --> 02:03:33,166
Here's your drink,
Colonel.

1647
02:03:38,296 --> 02:03:42,133
Oh. I'm so sorry.

1648
02:03:42,216 --> 02:03:44,677
What time do you want me
to turn down the bed ?

1649
02:03:44,719 --> 02:03:50,141
- Uh, maybe later, all right ?
- What he means, senorita,

1650
02:03:50,224 --> 02:03:52,059
is come right in.

1651
02:03:55,313 --> 02:03:59,484
- Later, please ?
- Yes, sir.

1652
02:03:59,567 --> 02:04:01,486
Good afternoon.

1653
02:04:05,406 --> 02:04:07,366
Nice voice.

1654
02:04:11,204 --> 02:04:13,206
Boy, you have
a one-track mind.

1655
02:04:13,289 --> 02:04:17,919
Mm-hmm. Is there anything else
in this world, Charlie ?

1656
02:04:19,754 --> 02:04:24,801
- Not for you.
- You know what's kept me
goin' all these years ?

1657
02:04:26,094 --> 02:04:30,723
The thought that one day --

1658
02:04:40,274 --> 02:04:42,235
Never mind.

1659
02:04:42,276 --> 02:04:44,070
The what ?

1660
02:04:46,114 --> 02:04:48,032
Silly.

1661
02:04:50,284 --> 02:04:52,912
Just the thought
that maybe one day, I'd --

1662
02:04:56,999 --> 02:04:59,961
I could have a woman's arms
wrapped around me...

1663
02:05:01,796 --> 02:05:04,924
and her legs
wrapped around me.

1664
02:05:06,759 --> 02:05:08,719
And what ?

1665
02:05:13,182 --> 02:05:17,395
That I could wake up in the morning
and she'd still be there.

1666
02:05:18,980 --> 02:05:20,898
Smell of her.

1667
02:05:21,774 --> 02:05:23,860
All funky and warm.

1668
02:05:28,322 --> 02:05:30,616
I finally gave up on it.

1669
02:05:33,494 --> 02:05:37,039
I don't know why
you can't have that.

1670
02:05:39,208 --> 02:05:41,669
You know, when we get back
to New Hampshire,

1671
02:05:41,711 --> 02:05:44,714
I don't know why
you can't find someone.

1672
02:05:44,797 --> 02:05:48,176
I mean, you're
a good-lookin' guy,

1673
02:05:48,259 --> 02:05:51,888
and you're fun
to be with, and...

1674
02:05:51,971 --> 02:05:57,143
you're a great travel companion,
sensitive, compassionate.

1675
02:06:01,230 --> 02:06:03,566
Charlie,

1676
02:06:03,649 --> 02:06:05,985
are you
fuckin' with me ?

1677
02:06:09,781 --> 02:06:13,993
Yes.

1678
02:06:15,077 --> 02:06:16,788
Yeah ?

1679
02:06:16,871 --> 02:06:19,665
Hey, Manny.

1680
02:06:21,584 --> 02:06:25,379
My God. We -- We --
We missed our plane.

1681
02:06:25,463 --> 02:06:29,175
Your plane, Charlie.
My ticket was one-way.

1682
02:06:31,552 --> 02:06:35,264
- New England Thruway
all the way, Colonel ?
- All the way, Rinaldo.

1683
02:06:47,652 --> 02:06:50,154
I'm gettin' that
heavy feelin' again, Charlie.

1684
02:06:51,489 --> 02:06:53,407
Uh...

1685
02:06:54,617 --> 02:06:56,744
"Uh" ?

1686
02:06:56,828 --> 02:06:59,997
I think you were right
about George and his father.

1687
02:07:00,081 --> 02:07:03,042
- Uh, I'm sorry to hear that.
- When we get back,

1688
02:07:03,084 --> 02:07:07,171
Mr. Trask is bringin' us up in front
of the whole school.

1689
02:07:07,255 --> 02:07:09,382
Puttin' your feet
to the fire, huh ?

1690
02:07:09,465 --> 02:07:12,301
Special meeting of
the Disciplinary Committee.

1691
02:07:14,095 --> 02:07:17,223
And what are you
gonna tell 'em ?

1692
02:07:19,350 --> 02:07:22,395
I don't know.
I'll think of somethin'.

1693
02:07:23,729 --> 02:07:27,692
Oh, Charlie, why are you
all alone in this thing ?

1694
02:07:27,775 --> 02:07:31,070
Hmm ? Where's your father ?

1695
02:07:32,447 --> 02:07:34,282
He left.

1696
02:07:35,700 --> 02:07:40,079
I thought it was a mom-and-pop store.
Who's the "pop" ?

1697
02:07:40,121 --> 02:07:44,584
- It's my stepfather.
- Oh, yeah.

1698
02:07:47,044 --> 02:07:48,963
But why isn't he in on this ?

1699
02:07:49,046 --> 02:07:51,340
Somethin'
wrong with him ?

1700
02:07:51,424 --> 02:07:55,178
No, he's okay.
We just, uh --

1701
02:07:55,261 --> 02:07:58,139
- We don't get along very well.
- Why not ?

1702
02:08:00,057 --> 02:08:03,936
- 'Cause he's an asshole.
- Ah. Ha-ha !

1703
02:08:06,063 --> 02:08:09,484
Well, that's all right, Charlie.

1704
02:08:11,235 --> 02:08:14,197
Every family's got one
nowadays.

1705
02:08:44,185 --> 02:08:46,729
- That's it ?
- That's it.

1706
02:08:46,813 --> 02:08:49,565
- Take care of yourself, kid.
- All right, Manny. Thanks.

1707
02:08:55,613 --> 02:08:57,532
No, I'm not open.

1708
02:08:59,784 --> 02:09:02,120
I hate good-byes.

1709
02:09:03,788 --> 02:09:08,209
So, uh, you'll be
all right, huh ?

1710
02:09:08,292 --> 02:09:10,920
I'll be fine.

1711
02:09:12,046 --> 02:09:14,340
All right.

1712
02:09:14,424 --> 02:09:17,510
- What's that ?

1713
02:09:19,345 --> 02:09:21,264
Uh, that's first bell.

1714
02:09:22,723 --> 02:09:25,768
Just got time
to get cleaned up.

1715
02:09:27,019 --> 02:09:29,564
Oh. I almost forgot.

1716
02:09:34,777 --> 02:09:37,280
I owe you some money.

1717
02:09:38,906 --> 02:09:42,952
Three hundred dollars,
hmm ? Job well done.

1718
02:09:45,746 --> 02:09:47,832
You ever need any
references, Charlie,

1719
02:09:47,915 --> 02:09:52,628
- I'm your man.
- Thanks, Colonel.

1720
02:09:59,719 --> 02:10:03,431
- Uh, it's 16 Water Street.
Just over the bridge.
- We'll find it.

1721
02:10:04,766 --> 02:10:06,809
Good-bye, Charlie.

1722
02:10:08,436 --> 02:10:10,354
Good-bye, Colonel.

1723
02:10:13,858 --> 02:10:15,777
Come here, son.

1724
02:10:31,542 --> 02:10:33,753
Okay, Manny.

1725
02:11:47,785 --> 02:11:49,871
George. George !

1726
02:12:28,618 --> 02:12:31,662
I called an open meeting
of this institution this morning...

1727
02:12:31,746 --> 02:12:35,208
because the incident that
occurred this Tuesday last...

1728
02:12:35,249 --> 02:12:39,337
describes an issue
that concerns all of us.

1729
02:12:40,680 --> 02:12:43,975
Not an isolated case
of vandalism, what happened...

1730
02:12:44,017 --> 02:12:48,563
is a symptom
of the sickness of a society,

1731
02:12:48,646 --> 02:12:52,567
a sickness which runs
counter to the principles...

1732
02:12:52,650 --> 02:12:54,569
this school was founded on,

1733
02:12:56,529 --> 02:13:01,743
a school, among whose graduates two have
sat behind the desk in the Oval Office,

1734
02:13:01,826 --> 02:13:04,704
in the White House.

1735
02:13:04,746 --> 02:13:07,874
Baird men have run state departments
and investment houses,

1736
02:13:07,957 --> 02:13:12,086
founded department stores
and coached football teams.

1737
02:13:12,170 --> 02:13:15,882
Our alumni receive their bulletins
in ashrams in India...

1738
02:13:15,965 --> 02:13:17,884
and in palaces
in Jordan.

1739
02:13:17,967 --> 02:13:20,178
We are, in fact,
known around the world...

1740
02:13:20,220 --> 02:13:23,014
as the cradle
of this country's leadership.

1741
02:13:23,056 --> 02:13:25,642
- A beacon in the nation's --
- What are you doing here ?

1742
02:13:25,725 --> 02:13:28,686
- Got room for me up there, Charlie ?
- But today,

1743
02:13:28,770 --> 02:13:31,731
- We are bleeding from disrespect,
- Yeah, I guess so.

1744
02:13:31,773 --> 02:13:35,860
- Give us a hand.
- disrespect for our values...

1745
02:13:35,944 --> 02:13:39,697
and a disrespect
for our standards,

1746
02:13:39,781 --> 02:13:43,243
a disrespect for
the Baird tradition.

1747
02:13:43,326 --> 02:13:46,829
And, as the custodians
of that tradition,

1748
02:13:46,913 --> 02:13:51,834
we are here today
to protect each other...

1749
02:13:51,918 --> 02:13:55,546
from those
who threaten it.

1750
02:13:55,630 --> 02:13:58,258
Who is this, Mr. Simms ?

1751
02:13:58,341 --> 02:14:02,345
- Uh --
- This is Mr. Frank Slade,

1752
02:14:02,428 --> 02:14:05,890
Lieutenant Colonel,
United States Army, retired.

1753
02:14:07,100 --> 02:14:09,394
I'm here in place
of Charlie's parents.

1754
02:14:09,477 --> 02:14:13,273
- Excuse me ?
- In loco parentis.

1755
02:14:15,191 --> 02:14:18,111
They could not make
the trip from Oregon today.

1756
02:14:18,152 --> 02:14:20,655
And what is your relationship
to Mr. Simms ?

1757
02:14:20,738 --> 02:14:24,033
Is this a courtroom ?

1758
02:14:24,117 --> 02:14:27,412
- Closest thing we could manage to it.
- Then if we're taking oaths,

1759
02:14:27,495 --> 02:14:29,998
there's a few people
I'd like to swear in.

1760
02:14:32,292 --> 02:14:37,005
There are no oaths at Baird.
We are all on our honor.

1761
02:14:39,465 --> 02:14:42,176
Larry and Franny Simms...

1762
02:14:42,260 --> 02:14:45,179
are very dear,
close friends of mine.

1763
02:14:45,263 --> 02:14:49,267
They've asked me to appear here
on Charlie's behalf.

1764
02:14:49,350 --> 02:14:51,936
Okay ?

1765
02:14:53,187 --> 02:14:55,648
Happy to have you
with us, Colonel.

1766
02:14:59,861 --> 02:15:01,821
Mr. Willis.

1767
02:15:03,656 --> 02:15:06,993
- Which Mr. Willis ?
- George, Junior, sir.

1768
02:15:11,623 --> 02:15:14,959
You were in a position
last Tuesday night...

1769
02:15:15,001 --> 02:15:19,047
to see who committed
this act of vandalism. Who was it ?

1770
02:15:21,424 --> 02:15:24,677
Well, uh, I have
an idea who it was.

1771
02:15:24,761 --> 02:15:28,181
No, no, not an idea, Mr. Willis.
Did you see or did you not see ?

1772
02:15:31,351 --> 02:15:33,269
Well...

1773
02:15:34,354 --> 02:15:37,148
I-l didn't have
my contacts in.

1774
02:15:40,652 --> 02:15:42,820
Come on.

1775
02:15:45,865 --> 02:15:48,826
I was in the library.
I'd taken my glasses off,

1776
02:15:48,910 --> 02:15:52,121
and I was gonna put
my contacts back in.

1777
02:15:52,205 --> 02:15:54,290
Um,

1778
02:15:54,374 --> 02:15:56,584
I --

1779
02:15:56,668 --> 02:15:58,586
Then I helped
Simms close up,

1780
02:15:58,670 --> 02:16:02,173
and the next thing I know,
we're outside,

1781
02:16:02,215 --> 02:16:06,052
and I hear this sound,
and l, um,

1782
02:16:06,135 --> 02:16:09,222
didn't have any time
to put my contacts in.

1783
02:16:09,305 --> 02:16:12,183
Whom, with your limited vision,
did you see ?

1784
02:16:29,993 --> 02:16:32,412
Like I say,
it was blurry.

1785
02:16:33,580 --> 02:16:35,707
Uh,

1786
02:16:37,834 --> 02:16:40,545
I can't see
without my contacts.

1787
02:16:40,587 --> 02:16:42,964
What did you see,
Mr. Willis ?

1788
02:16:43,047 --> 02:16:45,425
What ?

1789
02:16:45,508 --> 02:16:48,219
- What, you mean definitively ?
- Stop fencing with me, Mr. Willis !

1790
02:16:48,303 --> 02:16:51,264
Tell me what you saw !

1791
02:16:55,310 --> 02:16:57,896
Now, don't hold me
to this, but...

1792
02:16:57,979 --> 02:17:00,773
no contacts, it's dark...

1793
02:17:02,150 --> 02:17:04,110
and everything, I mean --

1794
02:17:04,152 --> 02:17:07,530
Mr. Willis !

1795
02:17:07,614 --> 02:17:12,076
Maybe...

1796
02:17:12,160 --> 02:17:14,746
Harry Havemeyer,

1797
02:17:14,787 --> 02:17:17,790
Trent Potter
and Jimmy Jameson.

1798
02:17:22,086 --> 02:17:25,173
- Maybe ?
- Ballpark, best guess.

1799
02:17:26,966 --> 02:17:31,179
Could you provide us
with some detail ?

1800
02:17:31,262 --> 02:17:33,598
I mean, why don't
you ask Charlie ?

1801
02:17:33,640 --> 02:17:36,935
I really think
he was closer.

1802
02:17:44,651 --> 02:17:46,611
Mr. Simms.

1803
02:17:46,653 --> 02:17:48,947
Yes.

1804
02:17:48,988 --> 02:17:51,199
You don't wear
contact lenses, do you ?

1805
02:17:51,282 --> 02:17:53,660
No, sir.

1806
02:17:55,078 --> 02:17:59,290
With your untrammeled sight,
whom did you see ?

1807
02:18:03,586 --> 02:18:05,755
Well, I saw --
I saw something,

1808
02:18:07,215 --> 02:18:10,218
but l-l-l
I couldn't say who.

1809
02:18:10,301 --> 02:18:13,221
All right..
What was the something you saw ?

1810
02:18:17,517 --> 02:18:20,311
- I-l couldn't say.
- You couldn't say or you wouldn't say ?

1811
02:18:23,022 --> 02:18:24,983
Well, I just --
I --

1812
02:18:28,695 --> 02:18:31,197
- I just couldn't say. I'm --
- Couldn't, wouldn't, shouldn't.

1813
02:18:31,239 --> 02:18:33,199
You're exhausting
my patience...

1814
02:18:33,241 --> 02:18:35,451
and making a mockery
of these proceedings.

1815
02:18:35,535 --> 02:18:36,661
I will give you
one last chance.

1816
02:18:36,703 --> 02:18:39,289
The consequences of your response
will be dire.

1817
02:18:39,372 --> 02:18:44,711
By dire I mean your future
will be jeopardized permanently.

1818
02:18:44,794 --> 02:18:47,046
Now for the last time,

1819
02:18:47,130 --> 02:18:49,716
what did you see
last Tuesday night...

1820
02:18:49,799 --> 02:18:51,718
outside my office ?

1821
02:18:54,929 --> 02:18:56,890
I saw somebody.

1822
02:18:56,931 --> 02:18:59,642
"l saw somebody." Good.

1823
02:19:00,727 --> 02:19:02,729
Did you see
their size and shape ?

1824
02:19:02,812 --> 02:19:05,607
Yeah.

1825
02:19:05,690 --> 02:19:09,152
And they were
the size and shape of whom ?

1826
02:19:14,782 --> 02:19:18,620
They were
the size and shape --

1827
02:19:32,258 --> 02:19:35,053
of most any
Baird student, sir.

1828
02:19:48,983 --> 02:19:51,611
I am left
with no real witness.

1829
02:19:53,196 --> 02:19:57,075
Mr. Willis's testimony is
not only vague, it is unsubstantiated.

1830
02:19:57,116 --> 02:20:00,078
The substance I was
looking for, Mr. Simms,

1831
02:20:00,119 --> 02:20:02,622
was to come from you.

1832
02:20:05,583 --> 02:20:07,543
I'm sorry.

1833
02:20:08,670 --> 02:20:11,422
I'm sorry too, Mr. Simms,

1834
02:20:11,464 --> 02:20:13,925
because you know
what I'm going to do,

1835
02:20:13,967 --> 02:20:16,302
inasmuch as I can't punish
Mr. Havemeyer,

1836
02:20:16,386 --> 02:20:18,471
Mr. Potter or Mr. Jameson ?

1837
02:20:18,555 --> 02:20:20,682
And I won't punish
Mr. Willis.

1838
02:20:20,765 --> 02:20:23,184
He's the only party
to this incident...

1839
02:20:23,268 --> 02:20:26,229
who is still worthy of
calling himself a Baird man.

1840
02:20:27,605 --> 02:20:30,775
I'm going to recommend to
the Disciplinary Committee...

1841
02:20:31,859 --> 02:20:33,820
that you be expelled.

1842
02:20:33,861 --> 02:20:36,698
Mr. Simms, you are
a cover-up artist...

1843
02:20:36,781 --> 02:20:38,700
and you are a liar.

1844
02:20:38,783 --> 02:20:40,868
But not a snitch !

1845
02:20:40,952 --> 02:20:43,454
Excuse me ?

1846
02:20:43,538 --> 02:20:45,290
No, I don't
think I will.

1847
02:20:45,373 --> 02:20:49,961
- Mr. Slade.
- This is such a crock of shit !

1848
02:20:50,003 --> 02:20:52,880
Please watch your
language, Mr. Slade.

1849
02:20:52,964 --> 02:20:55,883
You are in the Baird school,
not a barracks.

1850
02:20:55,967 --> 02:20:59,137
Mr. Simms, I will give you one
final opportunity to speak up.

1851
02:20:59,178 --> 02:21:01,723
Mr. Simms
doesn't want it.

1852
02:21:01,806 --> 02:21:03,725
He doesn't need
to be labeled...

1853
02:21:03,808 --> 02:21:06,477
"still worthy of
being a Baird man."

1854
02:21:06,519 --> 02:21:08,479
What the hell
is that ?

1855
02:21:08,521 --> 02:21:10,481
What is your motto here ?

1856
02:21:10,523 --> 02:21:14,777
"Boys, inform on your
classmates, save your hide;

1857
02:21:14,861 --> 02:21:17,739
anything short of that,
we're gonna burn you at the stake" ?

1858
02:21:17,822 --> 02:21:20,575
Well, gentlemen,

1859
02:21:20,658 --> 02:21:23,828
when the shit hits the fan,
some guys run...

1860
02:21:23,912 --> 02:21:25,872
and some guys stay.

1861
02:21:25,914 --> 02:21:29,375
Here's Charlie facin' the fire,
and there's George...

1862
02:21:29,459 --> 02:21:31,753
hidin' in
big daddy's pocket.

1863
02:21:31,836 --> 02:21:33,755
And what are you doin' ?

1864
02:21:33,838 --> 02:21:35,715
You're gonna
reward George...

1865
02:21:35,798 --> 02:21:39,177
and destroy Charlie.

1866
02:21:39,218 --> 02:21:43,598
-Are you finished, Mr. Slade ?
-No, I'm just gettin' warmed up.

1867
02:21:43,681 --> 02:21:46,226
I don't know who
went to this place.

1868
02:21:46,309 --> 02:21:49,020
William Howard Taft,
William Jennings Bryant,

1869
02:21:49,062 --> 02:21:51,022
William Tell, whoever.

1870
02:21:51,064 --> 02:21:54,192
Their spirit is dead,
if they ever had one.

1871
02:21:54,234 --> 02:21:56,194
It's gone.

1872
02:21:56,236 --> 02:21:58,738
You're buildin'
a rat ship here,

1873
02:21:58,780 --> 02:22:01,491
a vessel for
seagoin' snitches.

1874
02:22:01,574 --> 02:22:05,370
And if you think you're
preparin' these minnows for manhood,

1875
02:22:05,453 --> 02:22:07,413
you better think again,

1876
02:22:07,455 --> 02:22:10,416
because I say you are
killin' the very spirit...

1877
02:22:10,458 --> 02:22:12,627
this institution
proclaims it instills.

1878
02:22:12,710 --> 02:22:15,713
What a shame.

1879
02:22:15,797 --> 02:22:18,883
What kind of a show
are you guys puttin' on here today ?

1880
02:22:18,925 --> 02:22:22,470
I mean, the only class
in this act is sittin' next to me.

1881
02:22:22,554 --> 02:22:26,224
I'm here to tell you
this boy's soul is intact.

1882
02:22:26,307 --> 02:22:29,143
It's non-negotiable.
You know how I know ?

1883
02:22:29,227 --> 02:22:32,689
Someone here, and I'm not gonna say who,
offered to buy it.

1884
02:22:32,772 --> 02:22:36,401
- Only Charlie here wasn't sellin'.
- Sir, you're out of order.

1885
02:22:36,484 --> 02:22:38,861
I show you out of order.

1886
02:22:38,945 --> 02:22:41,948
You don't know what
out of order is, Mr. Trask.

1887
02:22:42,031 --> 02:22:44,450
I'd show you,
but I'm too old,

1888
02:22:44,534 --> 02:22:46,953
I'm too tired,
too fuckin' blind.

1889
02:22:47,036 --> 02:22:50,290
If I were the man I was
five years ago, I'd take...

1890
02:22:50,373 --> 02:22:52,709
a flamethrower
to this place !

1891
02:22:54,877 --> 02:22:58,798
Out of order ? Who the hell
you think you're talkin' to ?

1892
02:23:00,049 --> 02:23:02,885
I've been around,
you know ?

1893
02:23:02,969 --> 02:23:05,722
There was a time
I could see.

1894
02:23:05,805 --> 02:23:07,765
And I have seen.

1895
02:23:07,807 --> 02:23:10,184
Boys like these,
younger than these,

1896
02:23:10,268 --> 02:23:14,105
their arms torn out,
their legs ripped off.

1897
02:23:14,188 --> 02:23:17,233
But there is nothin'
like the sight...

1898
02:23:17,317 --> 02:23:19,277
of an amputated spirit.

1899
02:23:19,319 --> 02:23:23,072
There is
no prosthetic for that.

1900
02:23:23,156 --> 02:23:27,243
You think you're merely sendin'
this splendid foot soldier...

1901
02:23:27,327 --> 02:23:30,413
back home to Oregon with
his tail between his legs,

1902
02:23:30,455 --> 02:23:32,415
but I say you are...

1903
02:23:32,457 --> 02:23:35,752
executin' his soul !

1904
02:23:35,835 --> 02:23:38,087
And why ?

1905
02:23:38,129 --> 02:23:41,090
Because he's not
a Baird man.

1906
02:23:41,132 --> 02:23:43,927
Baird men.
You hurt this boy,

1907
02:23:44,010 --> 02:23:46,930
you're gonna be Baird bums,
the lot of you.

1908
02:23:46,971 --> 02:23:49,349
And, Harry, Jimmy,

1909
02:23:49,432 --> 02:23:52,602
Trent, wherever
you are out there,

1910
02:23:52,685 --> 02:23:56,940
fuck you too !

1911
02:23:56,981 --> 02:23:59,067
Stand down, Mr. Slade !

1912
02:23:59,150 --> 02:24:01,778
I'm not finished.

1913
02:24:01,819 --> 02:24:05,907
As I came in here,
I heard those words:

1914
02:24:05,990 --> 02:24:08,034
"cradle of leadership."

1915
02:24:08,117 --> 02:24:11,162
Well, when
the bough breaks,

1916
02:24:11,246 --> 02:24:14,582
the cradle will fall,
and it has fallen here.

1917
02:24:14,666 --> 02:24:16,584
It has fallen.

1918
02:24:16,668 --> 02:24:19,379
Makers of men,
creators of leaders.

1919
02:24:19,462 --> 02:24:22,840
Be careful what kind of leaders
you're producin' here.

1920
02:24:22,924 --> 02:24:26,719
I don't know if Charlie's
silence here today...

1921
02:24:26,803 --> 02:24:29,514
is right or wrong;
I'm not a judge or jury.

1922
02:24:29,597 --> 02:24:31,516
But I can tell you this:

1923
02:24:31,599 --> 02:24:33,643
he won't sell
anybody out...

1924
02:24:33,685 --> 02:24:36,521
to buy his future !

1925
02:24:36,604 --> 02:24:40,650
And that, my friends,
is called integrity.

1926
02:24:40,733 --> 02:24:42,694
That's called courage.

1927
02:24:42,735 --> 02:24:46,197
Now that's the stuff
leaders should be made of.

1928
02:24:51,452 --> 02:24:55,832
Now I have come to
the crossroads in my life.

1929
02:24:55,873 --> 02:25:00,378
I always knew
what the right path was.

1930
02:25:00,461 --> 02:25:04,173
Without exception, I knew,
but I never took it.

1931
02:25:04,257 --> 02:25:06,301
You know why ?

1932
02:25:06,384 --> 02:25:09,137
It was too damn hard.

1933
02:25:11,055 --> 02:25:14,142
Now here's Charlie.
He's come to the crossroads.

1934
02:25:14,225 --> 02:25:16,394
He has chosen a path.

1935
02:25:16,477 --> 02:25:18,605
It's the right path.

1936
02:25:18,688 --> 02:25:21,149
It's a path
made of principle...

1937
02:25:21,232 --> 02:25:23,568
that leads to character.

1938
02:25:25,403 --> 02:25:28,031
Let him continue
on his journey.

1939
02:25:29,866 --> 02:25:34,495
You hold this boy's future
in your hands, Committee.

1940
02:25:34,579 --> 02:25:37,206
It's a valuable future,

1941
02:25:37,248 --> 02:25:39,250
believe me.

1942
02:25:39,334 --> 02:25:43,630
Don't destroy it.
Protect it.

1943
02:25:43,713 --> 02:25:45,798
Embrace it.

1944
02:25:45,882 --> 02:25:49,510
It's gonna make you proud
one day, I promise you.

1945
02:26:06,444 --> 02:26:08,988
How's that for cornball ?

1946
02:26:29,634 --> 02:26:32,679
Nothing can
shut them up, sir.

1947
02:26:36,516 --> 02:26:39,477
The Disciplinary Committee will
take this matter under advisement...

1948
02:26:39,519 --> 02:26:42,105
in closed session.

1949
02:26:50,113 --> 02:26:54,951
- What are they doin', Charlie ?
- I think they're going
to come to a decision now.

1950
02:26:58,788 --> 02:27:00,707
Very well.

1951
02:27:06,379 --> 02:27:10,049
Apparently, that meeting
will be unnecessary.

1952
02:27:10,133 --> 02:27:12,302
Mrs. Hunsaker.

1953
02:27:15,847 --> 02:27:18,766
The joint student-faculty
Disciplinary Committee...

1954
02:27:18,850 --> 02:27:20,810
needs no further sessions.

1955
02:27:20,894 --> 02:27:23,271
They have come
to a decision.

1956
02:27:23,354 --> 02:27:25,982
Misters Havemeyer,
Potter and Jameson...

1957
02:27:26,065 --> 02:27:28,026
are placed
on probation...

1958
02:27:28,067 --> 02:27:31,905
for suspicion of
ungentlemanly conduct.

1959
02:27:31,988 --> 02:27:35,283
It is further recommended
that Mr. George Willis, Jr....

1960
02:27:35,366 --> 02:27:38,578
receive neither recognition
nor commendation...

1961
02:27:38,661 --> 02:27:40,955
for his cooperation.

1962
02:27:41,039 --> 02:27:44,000
Mr. Charles Simms
is excused...

1963
02:27:44,083 --> 02:27:46,920
from any further response
to this incident.

1964
02:27:47,003 --> 02:27:49,631
Whoo-ah.

1965
02:28:25,792 --> 02:28:27,877
Charlie !

1966
02:28:47,855 --> 02:28:52,026
- Last step.
- I can always count on you, Charlie.

1967
02:28:54,571 --> 02:28:56,864
Colonel.

1968
02:28:56,948 --> 02:28:58,950
Colonel !

1969
02:28:59,033 --> 02:29:01,160
I'm Christine Downes,
Colonel Slade.

1970
02:29:01,244 --> 02:29:03,162
I teach
Political Science.

1971
02:29:03,246 --> 02:29:05,456
I wanted to tell you
how much I appreciate...

1972
02:29:05,540 --> 02:29:08,084
- your coming here
and speaking your mind.
- Thank you. Are you married ?

1973
02:29:08,167 --> 02:29:11,004
Uh --
I, uh --

1974
02:29:12,630 --> 02:29:16,384
Went to a artillery school
at Fort Sill with a Mickey Downes.

1975
02:29:16,467 --> 02:29:18,386
Thought he might've
snagged you.

1976
02:29:18,469 --> 02:29:21,639
Uh, no, no,
I'm afraid not.

1977
02:29:21,723 --> 02:29:24,100
Uh, Colonel Slade was on, uh,

1978
02:29:24,183 --> 02:29:26,185
Lyndon Johnson's staff,
Miss Downes.

1979
02:29:26,269 --> 02:29:28,938
Were you ? Fascinating.

1980
02:29:29,022 --> 02:29:31,733
We should get together,
talk politics sometime.

1981
02:29:34,944 --> 02:29:36,863
Fleurs de rocailles.

1982
02:29:39,032 --> 02:29:40,992
Yes.

1983
02:29:41,993 --> 02:29:45,246
"Flowers from a brook."

1984
02:29:45,330 --> 02:29:47,540
That's right.

1985
02:29:50,168 --> 02:29:52,795
Well, Miss Downes,

1986
02:29:52,837 --> 02:29:56,299
I, I'll know
where to find you.

1987
02:29:56,382 --> 02:29:58,343
Charlie.

1988
02:29:58,384 --> 02:30:00,637
- Bye, Miss Downes..
- Bye.

1989
02:30:03,556 --> 02:30:07,268
You don't have
to tell me, Charlie.

1990
02:30:07,352 --> 02:30:10,146
5'7",

1991
02:30:10,230 --> 02:30:12,857
auburn hair,

1992
02:30:12,941 --> 02:30:16,402
beautiful
brown eyes.

1993
02:30:33,795 --> 02:30:36,005
Yabba dabba doo.

1994
02:30:37,090 --> 02:30:39,050
Hah !

1995
02:30:40,385 --> 02:30:42,512
Manny.

1996
02:30:43,846 --> 02:30:45,765
Aw, Colonel,
this is too much.

1997
02:30:45,848 --> 02:30:48,560
You earned it.
Next time Charlie and l...

1998
02:30:48,643 --> 02:30:51,437
want to take a breather to New York,
we're gonna call you.

1999
02:30:51,521 --> 02:30:53,439
You can drive us
both ways.

2000
02:30:53,523 --> 02:30:56,150
You're on. Not only
will it be an honor,

2001
02:30:56,234 --> 02:30:58,152
I'll give you
a rate.

2002
02:30:58,236 --> 02:31:00,989
I'll see your rate
and raise you.

2003
02:31:01,072 --> 02:31:03,032
Stay outta
harm's way, Manny.

2004
02:31:03,074 --> 02:31:06,202
- Take care, Colonel.
- You too.

2005
02:31:06,286 --> 02:31:09,747
- Ready ?
- No, thanks, Charlie.
I'll take it from here.

2006
02:31:09,789 --> 02:31:13,751
You go on ahead.
Manny'll drive you back to your dorm.

2007
02:31:13,835 --> 02:31:17,088
Come by before you
go home for Christmas.

2008
02:31:17,171 --> 02:31:19,549
We'll have a little cheer.

2009
02:31:19,591 --> 02:31:22,385
And if you like,
stay for dinner.

2010
02:31:22,427 --> 02:31:25,013
Sometimes she cooks
a pot roast.

2011
02:31:25,096 --> 02:31:27,015
It's almost edible.

2012
02:31:28,266 --> 02:31:30,184
All right, Colonel.

2013
02:31:30,268 --> 02:31:32,061
- That'd be really --
- Bye, Charlie.

2014
02:31:52,624 --> 02:31:54,584
Who's there ?

2015
02:31:54,626 --> 02:31:57,128
- That you, Francine ?
- Yes.

2016
02:31:57,170 --> 02:32:00,465
- What are you doing ?
- Taking a ride.

2017
02:32:00,548 --> 02:32:03,927
Taking a ride ?
What about you giving me a lift ?

2018
02:32:04,010 --> 02:32:07,263
- No.
- No ?

2019
02:32:07,305 --> 02:32:09,891
Aw, come on,
Francine.

2020
02:32:09,974 --> 02:32:13,269
We should make up.
Don't you think it's time we made up ?

2021
02:32:13,353 --> 02:32:15,730
- No..
- Francine ?

2022
02:32:15,813 --> 02:32:17,732
- What ?
- Your Uncle Frank's had himself...

2023
02:32:17,815 --> 02:32:22,403
a really hard
Thanksgiving weekend.

2024
02:32:22,487 --> 02:32:24,405
- What's that ?

2025
02:32:24,489 --> 02:32:26,699
I hear a chipmunk.

2026
02:32:26,783 --> 02:32:28,743
Is it a walrus ?

2027
02:32:28,826 --> 02:32:30,745
No, it's Willie.

2028
02:32:30,828 --> 02:32:33,581
Willie, why don't you
help me with my bag ?

2029
02:32:33,665 --> 02:32:36,501
Come on, son.
Help me with my bag.

2030
02:32:36,584 --> 02:32:38,836
Come on. Come on.

2031
02:32:38,920 --> 02:32:41,714
You got it. Hold onto it.
You're strong.

2032
02:32:41,798 --> 02:32:43,967
Come on.

2033
02:32:45,176 --> 02:32:47,679
Here we are.

2034
02:32:47,762 --> 02:32:50,223
Francine, come on
with me and Willie.

2035
02:32:50,306 --> 02:32:53,101
I'll let you make me
some marshmallow chocolate.

2036
02:32:53,184 --> 02:32:55,937
